Pertanyaan: Which step in testosterone synthesis is activated by luteinizing hormone (LH)

Konteks:
[1] and induces the expression of LH receptors on theca and granulosa cells. FSH also regulates the expression of aromatase in granulosa cells, thereby stimulating the production of  estradiol . LH acts on the theca cells to stim­ ulate the  de novo  synthesis of  androstenedione , the major precursor of ovarian estrogens in premenopausal women (see Figure 48–1). LH also is required for the rupture of the dominant follicle during ovulation and for the synthesis of progesterone by the corpus luteum.  In men , the actions of FSH and LH are less complex. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells to stimulate the production of proteins and nutrients required for sperm maturation. LH acts on testicular Leydig cells to stimulate the  de novo  synthesis of androgens, primarily  testosterone , from cholesterol. Regulation of Gonadotropin Synthesis and Secretion The predominant regulator of gonadotropin synthesis and secretion is the hypothalamic peptide GnRH, a decapeptide with blocked amino and carboxyl termini derived by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor peptide with 92 amino acids. GnRH is produced by a small population of neu­ rons in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus. These neurons are unique in their developmental origin, arising from the olfactory placode GnRH LH FSH Gonads Inhibin Accessory sex organs Other tissues Sex steroids Hypothalamus Anterior pituitary Target tissue Target tissue product Secondary target tissues Figure 46–6 The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.  A single hypothalam­ ic-releasing factor, GnRH, controls the synthesis and release of both gonad­ otropins (LH and FSH) in males and females. Gonadal steroid hormones (androgens, estrogens, and progesterone) exert feedback inhibition at the level of the pituitary and the hypothalamus. However, these feedback effects are dependent on sex, concentration, and time; the preovulatory surge of estrogen also can exert a stimulatory effect at the level of the pituitary and the hypothal­ amus. Inhibins, a family of polypeptide hormones produced by the gonads, specifically inhibit FSH secretion by the pituitary. https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 932 CHAPTER 46  INTRODUCTION TO ENDOCRINOLOGY: THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY AXIS mid-gestation and migrating to their final location prior to formation of the cribriform plate. Regulation of Pulsatile Secretion.   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion is pulsatile and varies in amplitude and frequency across mammalian species. Secretion is dynamically modulated by sex steroid feedback. Although some evidence indicates that GnRH neurons them­ selves are inherently pulsatile, developmental regulation of GnRH release through the onset of puberty and the modulation of GnRH secretion throughout the ovulatory cycle is largely governed by neurons in the arcuate nucleus, preoptic area, and periventricular area of the third ven­ tricle that co-express kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. Expres­ sion of these hormones exhibits strong sex differences and is sensitive to sex steroid feedback. GnRH neurons express GPR54, the kisspeptin receptor, and ultimately, kisspeptin action governs GnRH secretion. At birth, the reproductive hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is active but becomes quiescent postpartum. The axis remains so until shortly before puberty. At that time, CNS inhibition decreases and the amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses increase, particularly during sleep. As puberty progresses, the GnRH pulses increase further in amplitude and frequency until the normal adult pattern is established. The precise mediator gating the advancement to puberty is not well understood, but multiple lines of evidence suggest endocrine and metabolic mediators of body mass, adi­ posity, and energy balance may cumulatively promote reawakening of the axis and establish the rhythmicity of the ovulatory cycle in females and advancement of gonadal maturation in both sexes. The intermittent release of GnRH is crucial for the proper synthe­ sis and release of the gonadotropins; the continuous administration of GnRH leads to desensitization and downregulation of GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropes. LH synthesis and secretion are acutely sensi­ tive to GnRH pulses, whereas FSH, which is secreted through regulated and unregulated pathways, is less so. Molecular and Cellular Basis of GnRH Action.   GnRH signals through a unique GPCR on gonadotropes that lacks the typical caroboxyl-terminal intracellular tail that mediates β-arrestin desensitization of signaling. Activation of the receptor leads to a signaling response that is character­ ized by robust activation of the G q/11 -PLC-IP 3 -Ca 2+ , G q/11 -PLC-PKC-MAP kinase, and NADPH/dual oxidase–reactive oxygen species signaling pathways that are rapidly quenched through dual specificity phosphatase and antioxidant negative feedback (see Chapter 3). Activation results in increased LH and FSH secretion, activation of cap-dependent protein synthesis, and increased expression of glycoprotein hormone subunit genes. The magnitude of the cellular responses to GnRH stimulation is proportional to the amplitude and/or frequency of stimulation, and the gonadotrope is capable of interpreting GnRH pulse patterns, which is essential for proper timing of the female ovulatory cycle. Rapid GnRH pulses generally favor elevated LH secretion and ovulation, whereas slow pulses favor FSH secretion and promote follicular development. The GnRH receptors also are present in the ovary, testis, prostate, and breast, where their physiological significance remains to be determined. Sex Steroid Regulation of Gonadotropin Production.   Gonadal ste­ roids regulate gonadotropin production at the level of the pituitary and the hypothalamus, but effects on the hypothalamus predominate (see Figure 46–6). The feedback effects of gonadal steroids are dependent on sex, concentration, and time. In females, granulosa cell proliferation in the maturing follicle results in increased conversion of steroid precur­ sors to estradiol, which exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, promoting reduced pulsatile LH secretion. This negative feedback action restrains the neural GnRH pulse generator through upstream inhibition of kisspeptin neurons of the hypothalamic infundib­ ular nucleus (arcuate nucleus in rodents), and this may contribute to the postovulatory decrease in GnRH and LH pulse activity during the luteal phase (estrus in rodents). However, sustained elevated estradiol near the end of the follicular phase (proestrus in rodents) exerts positive feedback effects on a different kisspeptin population in the hypothalamic preop­ tic area. This estradiol-induced activation of preoptic kisspeptin neurons results in high stimulation of GnRH secretion, thereby stimulating a surge in LH release that triggers ovulation. In men, testosterone inhibits gonadotropin production via actions in the hypothalamus and pituitary, in part through direct actions and in part via its conversion by aromatase to estradiol.

[2] drogens, but they are not significant. Androgens Are Steroids .  All androgens are steroid compounds, as shown by the formulas in  Figure 81-­8  for testosterone  and  dihydrotestosterone.  Both in the testes and in the adrenals, the androgens can be synthesized either from cholesterol or directly from acetyl coenzyme A. Metabolism of Testosterone .  After secretion by the tes­ tes, about 97% of the testosterone becomes either loosely bound with plasma albumin or more tightly bound with a beta globulin called  sex hormone–binding globulin  and cir­ culates in the blood in these states for 30 minutes to several hours. By that time, the testosterone is either transferred to the tissues or degraded into inactive products that are subsequently excreted. Much of the testosterone that becomes fixed to the tis­ sues is converted within the tissue cells to  dihydrotestoster­ one,  especially in certain target organs such as the prostate gland in the adult and the external genitalia of the male fe­ tus. Some but not all actions of testosterone depend on this conversion. The intracellular functions are discussed later in this chapter. Degradation and Excretion of Testosterone .  The tes­ tosterone that does not become fixed to the tissues is rap­ idly converted, mainly by the liver, into  androsterone  and dehydroepiandrosterone  and simultaneously conjugated as either glucuronides or sulfates (glucuronides, particularly). These substances are excreted either into the gut by way of the liver bile or into the urine through the kidneys. Production of Estrogen in the Male .  In addition to tes­ tosterone, small amounts of estrogens are formed in the male (about one fifth the amount in the nonpregnant fe­ male), and a reasonable quantity of estrogens can be recov­ Interstitial cells of Leydig Germinal epithelium Blood vessel Fibroblasts Figure 81-­7   Interstitial cells of Leydig, the cells that secrete testos­ terone, located in the interstices between the seminiferous tubules.

The exact source of estrogens in the male is unclear, but the following information is known: 1.	 The concentration of estrogens in the fluid of the semi­ niferous tubules is quite high and probably plays an im­ portant role in spermiogenesis. This estrogen is believed to be formed by the Sertoli cells by converting testoster­ one to estradiol. 2.	 Much larger amounts of estrogens are formed from testosterone and androstanediol in other tissues of the body, especially the liver, probably accounting for as much as 80% of the total male estrogen production. FUNCTIONS OF TESTOSTERONE In general, testosterone is responsible for the distinguish­ ing characteristics of the masculine body. Even during fetal life, the testes are stimulated by chorionic gonadotropin from the placenta to produce moderate quantities of testos­ terone throughout the entire period of fetal development and for 10 or more weeks after birth; thereafter, essentially no testosterone is produced during childhood until about the ages of 10 to 13 years. Testosterone production then increases rapidly under the stimulus of anterior pituitary gonadotropic hormones at the onset of puberty and lasts throughout most of the remainder of life, as shown in  Fig­ ure 81-­9 , dwindling somewhat beyond age 50 to 60 years. Some studies, however, suggest that plasma testosterone levels may remain in the normal range in most healthy males as they age; only about 10% to 20% of men over 60 years of age and 50% of men over 80 years of age have “low” testosterone levels below 3 ng/ml (usually expressed clini­ cally as <300 ng/dl or <10.4 nmol/L). In recent years, it has become clear that there is a clear association between late onset reductions in testosterone and metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Functions of Testosterone During Fetal Development Testosterone begins to be elaborated by the male fetal tes­ tes at about the seventh week of embryonic life. Indeed, one of the major functional differences between the female and the male sex chromosome is that the male chromosome has the  sex-­determining region Y (SRY) gene that encodes a protein called the  testis determining fac­ tor  (also called the  SRY protein ). The SRY protein initiates a cascade of gene activations that cause the genital ridge cells to differentiate into cells that eventually become the testes and secrete testosterone, whereas the female chro­ mosome causes this ridge to differentiate into cells that secrete estrogens. Injection of large quantities of male sex hormone into pregnant animals causes development of male sex­ ual organs, even though the fetus is female. Also, early removal of the testes in the male fetus causes develop­ ment of female sexual organs. Thus, testosterone secreted by the fetal testes is responsible for development of the male body char­ acteristics, including the formation of a penis and a scrotum rather than formation of a clitoris and a vagina. It also causes formation of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and male genital ducts, while at the same time suppressing formation of female genital organs. Effect of Testosterone to Cause Descent of the Tes­ tes.  The testes usually descend into the scrotum during the last 2 to 3 months of gestation when the testes begin secreting reasonable quantities of testosterone. If a male child is born with undescended but otherwise normal tes­ tes, administration of testosterone usually causes the tes­ Figure 81-­9   The different stages of male sexual function as reflected by average plasma testoster­ one concentrations  (red line)  and sperm production (blue line)  at different ages.

Because the growth of the prostate gland and male pattern bald- ness depend on dihydrotestosterone rather than testosterone, 5 α -reductase inhibitors can be used as a treatment for  benign prostatic hypertrophy  and hair loss in males. The  mechanism of action  of androgens begins with binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone to an androgen-receptor protein in the cells of target tissues. The androgen-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, where it initiates gene transcription. New messenger ribonucleotides (mRNAs) are generated and translated into new proteins that are responsible for the various physiologic actions of androgens. Actions of Androgens In some target tissues, testosterone is the active andro- genic hormone. In other target tissues, testosterone must be activated to dihydrotestosterone by the action of  5 α -reductase  ( Box 10.3 ).  Table 10.1  is a summary of the target tissues for testosterone and dihydrotestos- terone and their respective actions. ♦	  Testosterone  is responsible for the fetal differentia- tion of the internal male genital tract: the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. At puberty, tes- tosterone is responsible for increased muscle mass, the pubertal growth spurt, closure of the epiphyseal plates, growth of the penis and seminal vesicles, deepening of the voice, spermatogenesis, and libido. Finally, as mentioned previously, testosterone medi- ates negative feedback effects on the anterior pitu- itary and the hypothalamus. ♦	  Dihydrotestosterone  is responsible for fetal differen- tiation of the external male genitalia (i.e., the penis, Hypothalamus Anterior pituitary Sertoli cells + Inhibin FSH Leydig cells + + LH GnRH Testosterone Paracrine – – + – Fig. 10.6    Control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in males. 470    •    Physiology The ovary has three zones. The  cortex  is the outer and largest zone. It is lined by germinal epithelium and contains all of the oocytes, each of which is enclosed in a follicle. The ovarian follicles are also responsible for steroid hormone synthesis. The  medulla  is the middle zone and is a mixture of cell types. The  hilum is the inner zone, through which blood vessels and lymphatics pass. The ovarian steroid hormones have both paracrine and endocrine functions. Locally, within the ovaries, the ovarian steroid hormones act to support the FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY The female gonads are the  ovaries,  which, together with the uterus and the fallopian tubes, constitute the female reproductive tract. The ovaries, analogous to the testes in the male, have two functions: oogenesis and secretion of the female sex steroid hormones, proges- terone and estrogen. Each adult ovary is attached to the uterus by ligaments, and running through these ligaments are the ovarian arteries, veins, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. BOX 10.3   Clinical Physiology: 5 α -Reductase Deficiency DESCRIPTION OF CASE.   Jenny was born with what appeared to be an enlarged clitoris, although neither her parents nor the doctor questioned the abnormality. Now, at 13 years old, Jenny’s girlfriends are develop- ing breasts and having menstrual periods, but she is experiencing none of these changes. In fact, her voice is deepening, she is becoming muscular like the boys, and her enlarged clitoris is growing larger. Jenny is diagnosed with a form of male pseudohermaphroditism that is caused by a deficiency of 5 α -reductase. On physical examination, she has no ovaries, no uterus, a blind vaginal pouch, a small prostate, a penis, descended testes, and hypospadias (urethral opening low on the underside of the penis). She has a male musculature but no body hair, facial hair, or acne. Her genotype is confirmed as 46,XY, and blood work shows a high-normal level of testosterone and a low level of dihydrotestosterone. Fibroblasts from genital skin have no 5 α -reductase activity. EXPLANATION OF CASE.   Jenny is a genotypic male with testes and no ovaries. Her testes secrete testosterone, but she lacks the enzyme 5 α -reductase. In normal males, some androgenic target tissues contain 5 α -reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; in those tissues, dihydrotestoster- one is the active androgen. Androgenic actions that utilize dihydrotestosterone include differentiation of the external male genitalia, stimulation of hair follicles, male pattern baldness, activity of sebaceous glands, and growth of the prostate. Other androgenic target tissues in normal males do not contain 5 α -reductase and do not synthesize dihydrotestosterone; in those tissues, testosterone is active. Androgenic actions that respond directly to testosterone include differentiation of internal male genital tract (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles), development of muscle mass, puber- tal growth spurt, growth of the penis, deepening of the voice, spermatogenesis, and libido. As a genetic male (46,XY), the presence of the Y chromosome determined that Jenny would have testes. Prenatally, the testes synthesized antimüllerian hormone and testosterone. Antimüllerian hormone suppressed development of the müllerian ducts into an internal female genital tract, so Jenny has no fallopian tubes, uterus, or upper one-third of the vagina. Testosterone caused differentiation of the wolffian ducts into the internal male genital tract (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles), a process that does not require dihy- drotestosterone and thus occurred even though she is lacking 5 α -reductase. However, differentiation of the external male genitalia (e.g., penis, scrotum) requires dihydrotestosterone. Thus deficiency of 5 α -reductase meant that Jenny’s external genitalia were not normally developed. At puberty, the clitoris grew and became more like a penis because of the high-normal circulat- ing level of testosterone; apparently, with high enough levels, the androgen receptors that mediate growth of the external genitalia can be activated. Her voice deep- ened and she acquired skeletal muscle mass, actions that are mediated by testosterone and do not require conversion to dihydrotestosterone. Despite acquiring many masculine characteristics, Jenny did not develop body and facial hair because the hair follicles require dihydrotestosterone. Jenny did not develop breasts because she did not have ovaries, which in normal females are the source of the estrogen required for breast development. — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li.pdf, 10 Reproductive Physiology, Female Reproductive Physiology, Male Reproductive Physiology, halaman 471, 472, 473
