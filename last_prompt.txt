[1] and induces the expression of LH receptors on theca and granulosa cells. FSH also regulates the expression of aromatase in granulosa cells, thereby stimulating the production of  estradiol . LH acts on the theca cells to stim­ ulate the  de novo  synthesis of  androstenedione , the major precursor of ovarian estrogens in premenopausal women (see Figure 48–1). LH also is required for the rupture of the dominant follicle during ovulation and for the synthesis of progesterone by the corpus luteum.  In men , the actions of FSH and LH are less complex. FSH acts on the Sertoli cells to stimulate the production of proteins and nutrients required for sperm maturation. LH acts on testicular Leydig cells to stimulate the  de novo  synthesis of androgens, primarily  testosterone , from cholesterol. Regulation of Gonadotropin Synthesis and Secretion The predominant regulator of gonadotropin synthesis and secretion is the hypothalamic peptide GnRH, a decapeptide with blocked amino and carboxyl termini derived by proteolytic cleavage of a precursor peptide with 92 amino acids. GnRH is produced by a small population of neu­ rons in the medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus. These neurons are unique in their developmental origin, arising from the olfactory placode GnRH LH FSH Gonads Inhibin Accessory sex organs Other tissues Sex steroids Hypothalamus Anterior pituitary Target tissue Target tissue product Secondary target tissues Figure 46–6 The hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis.  A single hypothalam­ ic-releasing factor, GnRH, controls the synthesis and release of both gonad­ otropins (LH and FSH) in males and females. Gonadal steroid hormones (androgens, estrogens, and progesterone) exert feedback inhibition at the level of the pituitary and the hypothalamus. However, these feedback effects are dependent on sex, concentration, and time; the preovulatory surge of estrogen also can exert a stimulatory effect at the level of the pituitary and the hypothal­ amus. Inhibins, a family of polypeptide hormones produced by the gonads, specifically inhibit FSH secretion by the pituitary. https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 932 CHAPTER 46  INTRODUCTION TO ENDOCRINOLOGY: THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY AXIS mid-gestation and migrating to their final location prior to formation of the cribriform plate. Regulation of Pulsatile Secretion.   Gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion is pulsatile and varies in amplitude and frequency across mammalian species. Secretion is dynamically modulated by sex steroid feedback. Although some evidence indicates that GnRH neurons them­ selves are inherently pulsatile, developmental regulation of GnRH release through the onset of puberty and the modulation of GnRH secretion throughout the ovulatory cycle is largely governed by neurons in the arcuate nucleus, preoptic area, and periventricular area of the third ven­ tricle that co-express kisspeptin, neurokinin B, and dynorphin. Expres­ sion of these hormones exhibits strong sex differences and is sensitive to sex steroid feedback. GnRH neurons express GPR54, the kisspeptin receptor, and ultimately, kisspeptin action governs GnRH secretion. At birth, the reproductive hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis is active but becomes quiescent postpartum. The axis remains so until shortly before puberty. At that time, CNS inhibition decreases and the amplitude and frequency of GnRH pulses increase, particularly during sleep. As puberty progresses, the GnRH pulses increase further in amplitude and frequency until the normal adult pattern is established. The precise mediator gating the advancement to puberty is not well understood, but multiple lines of evidence suggest endocrine and metabolic mediators of body mass, adi­ posity, and energy balance may cumulatively promote reawakening of the axis and establish the rhythmicity of the ovulatory cycle in females and advancement of gonadal maturation in both sexes. The intermittent release of GnRH is crucial for the proper synthe­ sis and release of the gonadotropins; the continuous administration of GnRH leads to desensitization and downregulation of GnRH receptors on pituitary gonadotropes. LH synthesis and secretion are acutely sensi­ tive to GnRH pulses, whereas FSH, which is secreted through regulated and unregulated pathways, is less so. Molecular and Cellular Basis of GnRH Action.   GnRH signals through a unique GPCR on gonadotropes that lacks the typical caroboxyl-terminal intracellular tail that mediates β-arrestin desensitization of signaling. Activation of the receptor leads to a signaling response that is character­ ized by robust activation of the G q/11 -PLC-IP 3 -Ca 2+ , G q/11 -PLC-PKC-MAP kinase, and NADPH/dual oxidase–reactive oxygen species signaling pathways that are rapidly quenched through dual specificity phosphatase and antioxidant negative feedback (see Chapter 3). Activation results in increased LH and FSH secretion, activation of cap-dependent protein synthesis, and increased expression of glycoprotein hormone subunit genes. The magnitude of the cellular responses to GnRH stimulation is proportional to the amplitude and/or frequency of stimulation, and the gonadotrope is capable of interpreting GnRH pulse patterns, which is essential for proper timing of the female ovulatory cycle. Rapid GnRH pulses generally favor elevated LH secretion and ovulation, whereas slow pulses favor FSH secretion and promote follicular development. The GnRH receptors also are present in the ovary, testis, prostate, and breast, where their physiological significance remains to be determined. Sex Steroid Regulation of Gonadotropin Production.   Gonadal ste­ roids regulate gonadotropin production at the level of the pituitary and the hypothalamus, but effects on the hypothalamus predominate (see Figure 46–6). The feedback effects of gonadal steroids are dependent on sex, concentration, and time. In females, granulosa cell proliferation in the maturing follicle results in increased conversion of steroid precur­ sors to estradiol, which exerts negative feedback on the hypothalamus and pituitary, promoting reduced pulsatile LH secretion. This negative feedback action restrains the neural GnRH pulse generator through upstream inhibition of kisspeptin neurons of the hypothalamic infundib­ ular nucleus (arcuate nucleus in rodents), and this may contribute to the postovulatory decrease in GnRH and LH pulse activity during the luteal phase (estrus in rodents). However, sustained elevated estradiol near the end of the follicular phase (proestrus in rodents) exerts positive feedback effects on a different kisspeptin population in the hypothalamic preop­ tic area. This estradiol-induced activation of preoptic kisspeptin neurons results in high stimulation of GnRH secretion, thereby stimulating a surge in LH release that triggers ovulation. In men, testosterone inhibits gonadotropin production via actions in the hypothalamus and pituitary, in part through direct actions and in part via its conversion by aromatase to estradiol.

Two forms of 5α-reductase have been identified:  type I , which is found predominantly in nongenital skin, liver, and bone; and type II , which is found predominantly in urogenital tissue in men and genital skin in men and women. The enzyme complex aromatase, pres­ ent in many tissues, catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. This conversion accounts for about 85% of circulating estradiol in men; the remainder is secreted directly by the testes (MacDonald et al., 1979). Hepatic metabolism converts testosterone to the biologically inactive compounds androsterone and etiocholanolone (see Figure 49–3). Dihy­ drotestosterone is metabolized to androsterone, androstanedione, and androstanediol. Physiological and Pharmacological Effects of Androgens Testosterone is the principal circulating androgen in men. At least three mechanisms contribute to the varied effects of testosterone: • Direct binding to the AR • Conversion in certain tissues to dihydrotestosterone, which also binds to the AR • Conversion to estradiol, which binds to the estrogen receptor (Figure 49–4) Effects That Occur via the Androgen Receptor Testosterone and dihydrotestosterone act as androgens via a single AR, a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily designated as NR3A. The AR has an amino-terminal domain that contains a polyglutamine repeat of variable length, a DNA-binding domain consisting of two Zn finger motifs, and a carboxyterminal ligand-binding domain. The polyglu­ tamine repeat of variable length is unique to the AR; a shorter length appears to increase the receptor’s activity. In the absence of a ligand, the AR is in the cytoplasm associated with a heat shock protein complex. When testosterone or dihydrotestosterone binds to the ligand-binding domain, the AR dissociates from the heat shock protein complex, dimerizes, and translocates to the nucleus. The dimer then binds via the DNA-binding domains to androgen response elements on certain responsive genes. The ligand-receptor complex recruits coactivators and acts as a transcription factor complex, stimulat­ ing or repressing expression of those genes (Agoulnik and Weigel, 2008). Mutations in the hormone- or DNA-binding regions of the AR result in resistance to the action of testosterone, beginning in utero (McPhaul and Griffin, 1999); consequently, male sexual differentiation and pubertal development are incomplete. Other AR mutations occur in patients with spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, known as  Kennedy disease . These patients have an expansion of the CAG (cytosine, adenine, guanine) repeat, 993 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY Active Metabolites DIHYDROTESTOSTERONE ESTRADIOL 5 α -reductase OH OH OH HO HO HO (aromatase) CYP19 O O O O H H H ANDROSTERONE ETIOCHOLANOLONE TESTOSTERONE 17 18 19 5 4 3 D C B A Inactive Metabolites Figure 49–3 Metabolism of testosterone to its major active and inactive metabolites. which codes for glutamine, at the amino terminus of the molecule (Walcott and Merry, 2002). The result is very mild androgen resistance, manifest principally by gynecomastia, and progressively severe motor neuron atro­ phy (Dejager et al., 2002). The mechanism by which the neuronal atrophy occurs is unknown. Other mutations in AR may explain why metastatic prostate cancer often regresses initially in response to androgen depriva­ tion treatment but then becomes unresponsive to continued deprivation. AR continues to be expressed in androgen-independent prostate cancer, and its signaling remains active. The ligand-independent signaling may result from mutations in the AR gene or changes in AR coregulatory pro­ teins. In some patients resistant to standard androgen deprivation therapy, the tumor responds to further depletion of androgens by inhibitors of adre­ nal androgen synthesis, such as  abiraterone . Effects That Occur via the Estrogen Receptor Certain effects of testosterone are mediated by its conversion to estradiol, catalyzed by  cytochrome P450  (CYP) type 19 (aromatase). In rare cases of males deficient in CYP19 or the estrogen receptor, the epiphyses do not fuse, and long-bone growth continues indefinitely; such patients are also osteoporotic. Administration of estradiol corrects the bone abnormalities in patients with aromatase deficiency but not in those with an estrogen- receptor defect. Because men have larger bones than women, and bone expresses the AR (Colvard et al., 1989), testosterone also may act on bone via the AR. Administration of estradiol to a male with CYP19 deficiency can increase libido, suggesting that the effect of testosterone on male libido may be mediated by conversion to estradiol (Smith et al., 1994).

[3] WHI:  Women’s Health Initiative pathway to increase cholesterol (the precursors of all steroids) transport into the mitochondria of cells, where androgen precursors are produced. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) then stimulates CYP19 production and activity in the granulosa cells, which converts the androgen pre­ cursors to estrogens. Notably, theca cells of the ovary contain a form of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (type I) that favors the production of testosterone and estradiol from androstenedione and estrone, respec­ tively. However, in the liver, another form of this enzyme (type II) favors oxidation of circulating estradiol to estrone (Peltoketo et al., 1999), and both of these steroids are then converted to estriol (Figure 48–1). All three of these estrogens are excreted in the urine along with their glucu­ ronide and sulfate conjugates. In postmenopausal women, the principal source of circulating estro­ gen is adipose tissue stroma, where estrone is synthesized from dehydro­ epiandrosterone secreted by the adrenals. In men, estrogens are produced by the testes, but extragonadal production by aromatization of circulat­ ing C19 steroids (e.g., androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone) accounts for most circulating estrogens (Simpson, 2003). HISTORY     Hormones in the Female Reproductive System The hormonal nature of the ovarian control of the female reproduc­ tive system was firmly established in 1900 by Knauer, when he found that ovarian transplants prevented the symptoms of gonadectomy, and by Halban, who showed that normal sexual development and function occurred when glands were transplanted. In 1923, Allen and Doisy devised a bioassay for ovarian extracts based on the vaginal smear of the rat. Frank and associates in 1925 detected an active sex principle in the blood of sows in estrus, and Loewe and Lange discov­ ered in 1926 that a female sex hormone varied in the urine of women throughout the menstrual cycle. The excretion of estrogen in the urine during pregnancy also was reported by Zondek in 1928 and enabled Butenandt and Doisy in 1929 to crystallize an active substance. Early investigations indicated that the ovary secretes two sub­ stances. Beard had postulated in 1897 that the corpus luteum serves a necessary function during pregnancy, and Fraenkel showed in 1903 that destruction of the corpora lutea in pregnant rabbits caused abor­ tion. Several groups then isolated progesterone from mammalian cor­ pora lutea in the 1930s. In the early 1960s, pioneering studies by Jensen and colleagues sug­ gested the presence of intracellular receptors for estrogens in target tissues. This was the first demonstration of receptors of the steroid/ thyroid superfamily and provided techniques to identify receptors for the other steroid hormones. A second estrogen receptor (ER) was identified in 1996 and was termed ERβ to distinguish it from the receptor identified earlier, termed ERα. Two protein isoforms, A and B, of the progesterone receptor (PR) arise from a single gene by tran­ scription initiation from different promoters. Estrogens may be locally produced from androgens by the actions of aromatase or from estrogen conjugates by hydrolysis. Such local produc­ tion of estrogens could play a causal or promotional role in the develop­ ment of certain diseases, such as breast cancer, because mammary tumors contain both aromatase and hydrolytic enzymes. Estrogens also may be produced from androgens via aromatase in the CNS and other tissues and exert local effects near their production site (e.g., in bone, they affect bone mineral density). The placenta uses fetal dehydroepiandrosterone and its 16α-hydroxyl derivative to produce large amounts of estrone and estriol. Human urine during pregnancy is thus an abundant source of natural estrogens. Preg­ nant mare’s urine is the source of  conjugated equine estrogens , which have been widely used therapeutically for many years. Physiological Actions Developmental Actions Estrogens are largely responsible for pubertal changes in girls and sec­ ondary sexual characteristics. Estrogens cause growth and development of the vagina, uterus, and fallopian tubes and contribute to breast enlarge­ ment. They also contribute to molding the body contours, shaping the skeleton, and causing the pubertal growth spurt of the long bones and epiphyseal closure. Growth of axillary and pubic hair, pigmentation of the genital region, and the regional pigmentation of the nipples and are­ olae that occur after the first trimester of pregnancy are also estrogenic actions. Androgens may also play a secondary role in female sexual devel­ opment (see Chapter 49). Estrogens appear to play important developmental roles in males. In boys, estrogen deficiency diminishes the pubertal growth spurt and delays skeletal maturation and epiphyseal closure so that linear growth continues into adulthood. Estrogen deficiency in men leads to macro­ orchidism and elevated gonadotropins and testosterone levels and may 961 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY HO H 3 C H 3 C O O H 3 C H 3 C O Dehydroepiandrosterone Androstenedione 3 β -OH-SDH aromatase A B C D 16 3 OH H 3 C H 3 C O 17 Testosterone 17-OH-SDH aromatase 16 α -OHase HO H 3 C H 3 C O OH H 3 C O 16 α -Hydroxydehydro- epiandrosterone Estrone OH H 3 C Estradiol 17-OH-SDH 3 β -OH-SDH H 3 C H 3 C O H 3 C 16 α -Hydroxyandrostenedione Estriol O OH 17-OH-SDH, aromatase 17-OH-SDH 16 α -OHase 16 α -OHase HO HO HO OH OH 3 β -OH-SDH 3 β -Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17-OH-SDH 17-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 16 α -OHase 16 α -Hydroxylase Figure 48–1 The biosynthetic pathway for the estrogens.

[4] drogens, but they are not significant. Androgens Are Steroids .  All androgens are steroid compounds, as shown by the formulas in  Figure 81-­8  for testosterone  and  dihydrotestosterone.  Both in the testes and in the adrenals, the androgens can be synthesized either from cholesterol or directly from acetyl coenzyme A. Metabolism of Testosterone .  After secretion by the tes­ tes, about 97% of the testosterone becomes either loosely bound with plasma albumin or more tightly bound with a beta globulin called  sex hormone–binding globulin  and cir­ culates in the blood in these states for 30 minutes to several hours. By that time, the testosterone is either transferred to the tissues or degraded into inactive products that are subsequently excreted. Much of the testosterone that becomes fixed to the tis­ sues is converted within the tissue cells to  dihydrotestoster­ one,  especially in certain target organs such as the prostate gland in the adult and the external genitalia of the male fe­ tus. Some but not all actions of testosterone depend on this conversion. The intracellular functions are discussed later in this chapter. Degradation and Excretion of Testosterone .  The tes­ tosterone that does not become fixed to the tissues is rap­ idly converted, mainly by the liver, into  androsterone  and dehydroepiandrosterone  and simultaneously conjugated as either glucuronides or sulfates (glucuronides, particularly). These substances are excreted either into the gut by way of the liver bile or into the urine through the kidneys. Production of Estrogen in the Male .  In addition to tes­ tosterone, small amounts of estrogens are formed in the male (about one fifth the amount in the nonpregnant fe­ male), and a reasonable quantity of estrogens can be recov­ Interstitial cells of Leydig Germinal epithelium Blood vessel Fibroblasts Figure 81-­7   Interstitial cells of Leydig, the cells that secrete testos­ terone, located in the interstices between the seminiferous tubules.

The exact source of estrogens in the male is unclear, but the following information is known: 1.	 The concentration of estrogens in the fluid of the semi­ niferous tubules is quite high and probably plays an im­ portant role in spermiogenesis. This estrogen is believed to be formed by the Sertoli cells by converting testoster­ one to estradiol. 2.	 Much larger amounts of estrogens are formed from testosterone and androstanediol in other tissues of the body, especially the liver, probably accounting for as much as 80% of the total male estrogen production. FUNCTIONS OF TESTOSTERONE In general, testosterone is responsible for the distinguish­ ing characteristics of the masculine body. Even during fetal life, the testes are stimulated by chorionic gonadotropin from the placenta to produce moderate quantities of testos­ terone throughout the entire period of fetal development and for 10 or more weeks after birth; thereafter, essentially no testosterone is produced during childhood until about the ages of 10 to 13 years. Testosterone production then increases rapidly under the stimulus of anterior pituitary gonadotropic hormones at the onset of puberty and lasts throughout most of the remainder of life, as shown in  Fig­ ure 81-­9 , dwindling somewhat beyond age 50 to 60 years. Some studies, however, suggest that plasma testosterone levels may remain in the normal range in most healthy males as they age; only about 10% to 20% of men over 60 years of age and 50% of men over 80 years of age have “low” testosterone levels below 3 ng/ml (usually expressed clini­ cally as <300 ng/dl or <10.4 nmol/L). In recent years, it has become clear that there is a clear association between late onset reductions in testosterone and metabolic disorders such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Functions of Testosterone During Fetal Development Testosterone begins to be elaborated by the male fetal tes­ tes at about the seventh week of embryonic life. Indeed, one of the major functional differences between the female and the male sex chromosome is that the male chromosome has the  sex-­determining region Y (SRY) gene that encodes a protein called the  testis determining fac­ tor  (also called the  SRY protein ). The SRY protein initiates a cascade of gene activations that cause the genital ridge cells to differentiate into cells that eventually become the testes and secrete testosterone, whereas the female chro­ mosome causes this ridge to differentiate into cells that secrete estrogens. Injection of large quantities of male sex hormone into pregnant animals causes development of male sex­ ual organs, even though the fetus is female. Also, early removal of the testes in the male fetus causes develop­ ment of female sexual organs. Thus, testosterone secreted by the fetal testes is responsible for development of the male body char­ acteristics, including the formation of a penis and a scrotum rather than formation of a clitoris and a vagina. It also causes formation of the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and male genital ducts, while at the same time suppressing formation of female genital organs. Effect of Testosterone to Cause Descent of the Tes­ tes.  The testes usually descend into the scrotum during the last 2 to 3 months of gestation when the testes begin secreting reasonable quantities of testosterone. If a male child is born with undescended but otherwise normal tes­ tes, administration of testosterone usually causes the tes­ Figure 81-­9   The different stages of male sexual function as reflected by average plasma testoster­ one concentrations  (red line)  and sperm production (blue line)  at different ages.

Because the growth of the prostate gland and male pattern bald- ness depend on dihydrotestosterone rather than testosterone, 5 α -reductase inhibitors can be used as a treatment for  benign prostatic hypertrophy  and hair loss in males. The  mechanism of action  of androgens begins with binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone to an androgen-receptor protein in the cells of target tissues. The androgen-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, where it initiates gene transcription. New messenger ribonucleotides (mRNAs) are generated and translated into new proteins that are responsible for the various physiologic actions of androgens. Actions of Androgens In some target tissues, testosterone is the active andro- genic hormone. In other target tissues, testosterone must be activated to dihydrotestosterone by the action of  5 α -reductase  ( Box 10.3 ).  Table 10.1  is a summary of the target tissues for testosterone and dihydrotestos- terone and their respective actions. ♦	  Testosterone  is responsible for the fetal differentia- tion of the internal male genital tract: the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. At puberty, tes- tosterone is responsible for increased muscle mass, the pubertal growth spurt, closure of the epiphyseal plates, growth of the penis and seminal vesicles, deepening of the voice, spermatogenesis, and libido. Finally, as mentioned previously, testosterone medi- ates negative feedback effects on the anterior pitu- itary and the hypothalamus. ♦	  Dihydrotestosterone  is responsible for fetal differen- tiation of the external male genitalia (i.e., the penis, Hypothalamus Anterior pituitary Sertoli cells + Inhibin FSH Leydig cells + + LH GnRH Testosterone Paracrine – – + – Fig. 10.6    Control of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion in males. 470    •    Physiology The ovary has three zones. The  cortex  is the outer and largest zone. It is lined by germinal epithelium and contains all of the oocytes, each of which is enclosed in a follicle. The ovarian follicles are also responsible for steroid hormone synthesis. The  medulla  is the middle zone and is a mixture of cell types. The  hilum is the inner zone, through which blood vessels and lymphatics pass. The ovarian steroid hormones have both paracrine and endocrine functions. Locally, within the ovaries, the ovarian steroid hormones act to support the FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE PHYSIOLOGY The female gonads are the  ovaries,  which, together with the uterus and the fallopian tubes, constitute the female reproductive tract. The ovaries, analogous to the testes in the male, have two functions: oogenesis and secretion of the female sex steroid hormones, proges- terone and estrogen. Each adult ovary is attached to the uterus by ligaments, and running through these ligaments are the ovarian arteries, veins, lymphatic vessels, and nerves. BOX 10.3   Clinical Physiology: 5 α -Reductase Deficiency DESCRIPTION OF CASE.   Jenny was born with what appeared to be an enlarged clitoris, although neither her parents nor the doctor questioned the abnormality. Now, at 13 years old, Jenny’s girlfriends are develop- ing breasts and having menstrual periods, but she is experiencing none of these changes. In fact, her voice is deepening, she is becoming muscular like the boys, and her enlarged clitoris is growing larger. Jenny is diagnosed with a form of male pseudohermaphroditism that is caused by a deficiency of 5 α -reductase. On physical examination, she has no ovaries, no uterus, a blind vaginal pouch, a small prostate, a penis, descended testes, and hypospadias (urethral opening low on the underside of the penis). She has a male musculature but no body hair, facial hair, or acne. Her genotype is confirmed as 46,XY, and blood work shows a high-normal level of testosterone and a low level of dihydrotestosterone. Fibroblasts from genital skin have no 5 α -reductase activity. EXPLANATION OF CASE.   Jenny is a genotypic male with testes and no ovaries. Her testes secrete testosterone, but she lacks the enzyme 5 α -reductase. In normal males, some androgenic target tissues contain 5 α -reductase, which converts testosterone to dihydrotestosterone; in those tissues, dihydrotestoster- one is the active androgen. Androgenic actions that utilize dihydrotestosterone include differentiation of the external male genitalia, stimulation of hair follicles, male pattern baldness, activity of sebaceous glands, and growth of the prostate. Other androgenic target tissues in normal males do not contain 5 α -reductase and do not synthesize dihydrotestosterone; in those tissues, testosterone is active. Androgenic actions that respond directly to testosterone include differentiation of internal male genital tract (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles), development of muscle mass, puber- tal growth spurt, growth of the penis, deepening of the voice, spermatogenesis, and libido. As a genetic male (46,XY), the presence of the Y chromosome determined that Jenny would have testes. Prenatally, the testes synthesized antimüllerian hormone and testosterone. Antimüllerian hormone suppressed development of the müllerian ducts into an internal female genital tract, so Jenny has no fallopian tubes, uterus, or upper one-third of the vagina. Testosterone caused differentiation of the wolffian ducts into the internal male genital tract (epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicles), a process that does not require dihy- drotestosterone and thus occurred even though she is lacking 5 α -reductase. However, differentiation of the external male genitalia (e.g., penis, scrotum) requires dihydrotestosterone. Thus deficiency of 5 α -reductase meant that Jenny’s external genitalia were not normally developed. At puberty, the clitoris grew and became more like a penis because of the high-normal circulat- ing level of testosterone; apparently, with high enough levels, the androgen receptors that mediate growth of the external genitalia can be activated. Her voice deep- ened and she acquired skeletal muscle mass, actions that are mediated by testosterone and do not require conversion to dihydrotestosterone. Despite acquiring many masculine characteristics, Jenny did not develop body and facial hair because the hair follicles require dihydrotestosterone. Jenny did not develop breasts because she did not have ovaries, which in normal females are the source of the estrogen required for breast development. — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 10 Reproductive Physiology, Female Reproductive Physiology, Male Reproductive Physiology, Halaman 471, 472, 473

Thus the follicular phase is dominated by negative feedback effects of estradiol on the hypothalamic- pituitary axis. ♦	  At  midcycle,  the feedback pattern reverses. Estradiol levels rise sharply as a result of the proliferation of follicular cells and the stimulation of estradiol syn- thesis that occurred during the follicular phase. When a critical level of estradiol is reached (of at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma), estra- diol has a  positive  feedback effect on GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus and on FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary (by up-regulating GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary), thus causing further secretion  of FSH and LH.

In turn, estrogen promotes the growth and development of the female reproductive tract: the uterus, fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina. Progesterone is also active in these tissues, usually increasing their secretory activity. Thus in the uterus,  estrogen causes cell proliferation, cell growth, and increased contractility; progesterone increases secretory activity and decreases contractility. In the fallopian tubes,  estrogen stimulates ciliary activity and contractility, aiding in the movement of sperm toward the uterus; progesterone increases secretory activity and decreases contractility. In the  vagina,  estrogen stimulates proliferation of epithelial cells; progesterone stimulates differentiation but inhibits proliferation of epithelial cells. Menstrual Cycle Over the course of the menstrual cycle, estrogen and progesterone are responsible for the changes that occur in the endometrium, cervix, and vagina and are respon- sible for feedback regulation of FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary. Based on a “typical” 28-day cycle, the  follicular phase  of the menstrual cycle is the 14-day period preceding ovulation. This phase, which is also called the  proliferative phase,  is dominated by estrogen. 17 β -Estradiol, whose secretion increases markedly during this phase, has significant effects on the endo- metrial lining of the uterus, preparing it for the  possibil- ity  of accepting a fertilized ovum: Estradiol stimulates growth of the endometrium, growth of glands and stroma, and elongation of the spiral arteries, which supply the endometrium. Estradiol also causes the cervical mucus to become copious, watery, and elastic. When spread on a glass slide, cervical mucus from the follicular phase produces a pattern known as “ferning.” This characteristic of cervical mucus has physiologic significance: Channels form in the watery mucus, creat- ing openings in the cervix through which sperm can be propelled. The  luteal phase  of a 28-day menstrual cycle is the 14-day period following ovulation. This phase also is called the  secretory phase  and is dominated by pro- gesterone. Proliferation of the endometrium slows, and its thickness decreases. The uterine glands become more tortuous, accumulate glycogen in vacuoles, and increase their mucus secretions. The stroma of the endometrium becomes edematous. The spiral arteries elongate more and become coiled. Progesterone secre- tion decreases the quantity of cervical mucus, which then becomes thick and nonelastic and does not “fern” on a slide.

[7] genesis in the testicular Sertoli cells and endocrine effects on other target organs (e.g., skeletal muscle and the prostate). 10—Reproductive Physiology    •    467 important differences: (1) The testes  lack  the enzymes 21 β -hydroxylase and 11 β -hydroxylase and therefore cannot synthesize glucocorticoids or mineralocorti- coids, and (2) the testes have an additional enzyme, 17 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,  which converts androstenedione to testosterone. Thus the androgenic end product of the testes is testosterone rather than dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and androstenedione (the androgenic end products of the adrenal cortex). Testosterone is not active in  all  androgenic target tissues. In  some  tissues,  dihydrotestosterone  is the active androgen. In those tissues, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone by the enzyme 5 α -reductase. Ninety-eight percent of the circulating testosterone is bound to plasma proteins, such as  sex hormone– binding globulin  and albumin. Because only free (unbound) testosterone is biologically active, sex hormone–binding globulin essentially functions as a reservoir for the circulating hormone. The synthesis of sex hormone–binding globulin is stimulated by estro- gens and inhibited by androgens. Ejaculated sperm cannot immediately fertilize an ovum: They must reside in the female reproductive tract for 4–6 hours for  capacitation  to occur. Capacita- tion is a process in which inhibitory factors in the seminal fluid are washed free, cholesterol is withdrawn from the sperm membrane, and surface proteins are redistributed. Ca 2 +  influx into the sperm increases their motility, and the motion of the sperm becomes whip- like. Capacitation also results in the  acrosomal reaction in which the acrosomal membrane fuses with the outer sperm membrane. This fusion creates pores through which hydrolytic and proteolytic enzymes can escape from the acrosome, creating a path for sperm to pen- etrate the protective coverings of the ovum. Synthesis and Secretion of Testosterone Testosterone, the major androgenic hormone, is syn- thesized and secreted by the Leydig cells of the testes. The steroidogenic pathways in the testes, shown in Figure 10.5 , are similar to those previously described for the adrenal cortex (see Chapter 9, Fig. 9.23), with two Primary spermatocytes (diploid 4N) Meiosis I completed Secondary spermatocytes (haploid 2N) Meiosis II Spermatids (haploid 1N) Spermatozoa (haploid 1N) Spermiogenesis End piece Principal piece Middle piece Mitochondria Nucleus Acrosome Head Fig. 10.4    Development and structure of the spermatozoon. 468    •    Physiology hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood and then deliv- ered in high concentration directly to the anterior lobe of the pituitary. Recall that throughout the reproductive period GnRH secretion is  pulsatile  and drives a parallel pulsatile secretory pattern of FSH and LH from the anterior lobe. (Note that if GnRH is administered con- tinuously, the high levels down-regulate GnRH recep- tors and thereby inhibit FSH and LH secretion. This principle is employed in the treatment of prostate cancer to inhibit LH and testosterone secretion.) FSH and LH FSH and LH are the anterior pituitary hormones (gonadotropins) that stimulate the testes to perform their spermatogenic and endocrine functions. FSH and LH are members of the glycoprotein hormone family that includes TSH and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG); all members of the family have identical α  subunits but unique  β  subunits that confer biologic activity.  FSH  stimulates spermatogenesis and Sertoli cell function.  LH  stimulates the Leydig cells to synthe- size testosterone by increasing the activity of cholesterol desmolase. Thus the function of LH in the testes paral- lels the function of ACTH in the adrenal cortex: It stimulates the first step in the steroidogenic pathway. Testosterone, secreted by the Leydig cells, has func- tions both locally within the testes (paracrine effects) and on other target tissues (endocrine effects). Intra- testicularly, testosterone diffuses from the Leydig cells to the nearby Sertoli cells, where it reinforces the spermatogenic action of FSH. Extratesticularly, testos- terone is secreted into the general circulation and delivered to its target tissues. Negative Feedback The hypothalamic-pituitary axis in the male is con- trolled by  negative feedback,  which has two paths. In the first path,  testosterone  itself feeds back on both the hypothalamus and the anterior lobe, where it inhibits the secretion of GnRH and LH. At the hypothalamic level, testosterone decreases both the frequency and amplitude of the GnRH pulses. In the second path, the Sertoli cells secrete a substance called  inhibin.  Inhibin is a glycoprotein that is a feedback inhibitor of FSH secretion by the anterior pituitary. Thus the Sertoli cells, which produce sperm, synthesize their own feedback inhibitor that serves as an “indicator” of the spermatogenic activity of the testes. Negative feedback control of the hypothalamic- pituitary axis is illustrated when circulating levels of testosterone are decreased (e.g., testes are removed). Under such conditions, the frequency and amplitude of GnRH, FSH, and LH pulses are  increased  because of decreased feedback inhibition by testosterone on the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary. Regulation of the Testes Both functions of the testes, spermatogenesis and secretion of testosterone, are controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis ( Fig. 10.6 ). The hypotha- lamic hormone is GnRH, and the anterior pituitary hormones are FSH and LH. GnRH GnRH is a decapeptide that is secreted by hypothalamic neurons in the  arcuate nuclei.  GnRH is secreted into Testosterone Cholesterol Pregnenolone 17-Hydroxypregnenolone cholesterol desmolase 17 α -hydroxylase LH Dehydroepiandrosterone Androstenedione 17,20 -lyase 3 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase Dihydrotestosterone 5 α -reductase (target tissues) + Fig. 10.5    Biosynthetic pathway for testosterone synthesis in the testes.

Because the growth of the prostate gland and male pattern bald- ness depend on dihydrotestosterone rather than testosterone, 5 α -reductase inhibitors can be used as a treatment for  benign prostatic hypertrophy  and hair loss in males. The  mechanism of action  of androgens begins with binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone to an androgen-receptor protein in the cells of target tissues.

[8] A, multiple molecules of which can combine to form the appropriate steroid nucleus. During synthesis, mainly progesterone and andro­ gens (testosterone and androstenedione) are syn­ thesized first; then, during the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, before these two initial hormones can leave the ovaries, almost all the androgens and much of the progesterone are converted into estro­ gens by the enzyme  aromatase  in the granulosa cells. Because the theca cells lack aromatase, they cannot convert androgens to estrogens. However, androgens diffuse out of the theca cells into the adjacent granu­ losa cells, where they are converted to estrogens by aromatase, the activity of which is stimulated by FSH ( Figure 82-­8 ).

Also, about one-fifteenth as much testosterone is secreted into the plasma of the female by the ovaries as is secreted into the plasma of the male by the testes. Estrogens and Progesterone Are Transported in the Blood Bound to Plasma Proteins.  Both estrogens and progesterone are transported in the blood bound main­ ly with plasma albumin and with specific estrogen-­ and progesterone-­binding globulins. The binding between these hormones and the plasma proteins is loose enough that they are rapidly released to the tissues over a period of 30 minutes or so. Functions of the Liver in Estrogen Degradation.  The liver conjugates estrogens to form glucuronides and sulfates, and about one-fifth of these conjugated products is excreted in the bile; most of the remainder is excreted in the urine. Also, the liver converts the potent estrogens estradiol and estrone into the almost totally impotent estrogen estriol. Therefore, diminished liver function actually  increases  the activity of es­ trogens in the body, sometimes causing  hyperestrinism. Fate of Progesterone.  Within a few minutes after se­ cretion, almost all the progesterone is degraded to other steroids that have no progestational effect. As with the estrogens, the liver is especially important for this meta­ bolic degradation. The major end product of progesterone degradation is pregnanediol.  About 10% of the original progesterone is excreted in the urine in this form. Therefore, one can esti­ mate the rate of progesterone formation in the body from the rate of this excretion. FUNCTIONS OF THE ESTROGENS—THEIR EFFECTS ON THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY FEMALE SEX CHARACTERISTICS A primary function of the estrogens is to cause cellular proliferation and growth of the tissues of the sex organs and other tissues related to reproduction. Effect of Estrogens on the Uterus and External Fe­ male Sex Organs.  During childhood, estrogens are secreted only in minute quantities, but at puberty, the quantity secreted in the female under the influence of the pituitary gonadotropic hormones increases 20-­fold or more. At this time, the female sex organs change from those of a child to those of an adult. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and vagina all increase several times in size. Also, the external genitalia enlarge, with deposition of fat in the mons pubis and labia majora and enlargement of the labia minora. In addition, estrogens change the vaginal epithelium from a cuboidal into a stratified type, which is consider­ ably more resistant to trauma and infection than is the prepubertal cuboidal cell epithelium. Vaginal infections in children can often be cured by the administration of estrogens simply because of the resulting increased resis­ tance of the vaginal epithelium. During the first few years after puberty, the size of the uterus increases 2-­fold to 3-­fold, but more important than the increase in uterus size are the changes that take place in the uterine endometrium under the influence of estrogens. Estrogens cause marked proliferation of the endometrial stroma and greatly increased development of the endome­ trial glands, which will later aid in providing nutrition to the implanted ovum. These effects are discussed later in the chapter in connection with the endometrial cycle. Figure 82-­8.   Interaction of fol­ licular theca and granulosa cells for production of estrogens. The theca cells, under the control of luteinizing hormone (LH), produce androgens that diffuse into the granulosa cells.

The estro­ gens’ effects on the mucosal lining of the fallopian tubes are similar to their effects on the uterine endometrium. They cause the glandular tissues of this lining to prolifer­ ate, and especially important, they cause the number of ciliated epithelial cells that line the fallopian tubes to in­ crease. Also, activity of the cilia is considerably enhanced. These cilia always beat toward the uterus, which helps propel the fertilized ovum in that direction. Effect of Estrogens on the Breasts.  The primordial breasts of females and males are exactly alike. In fact, un­ der the influence of appropriate hormones, the masculine breast during the first 2 decades of life can develop suffi­ ciently to produce milk in the same manner as the female breast.

[9] in women after oophorectomy. GnRH agonists are used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer or metastatic disease for women who have functioning ovaries; typically, they are used in combination with either tamoxifen  or AIs. In treating prostate cancer, the most common form of ADT involves chemical suppression of pituitary gland function with long-acting GnRH agonists ( leuprolide ,  goserelin ,  buserelin ). ADT is given to patients with localized intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer in conjunction with radiation therapy or in some cases following surgical removal of the pros­ tate gland. GnRH agonists cause an initial release of both LH and FSH and a subsequent increase in testosterone production termed “testoster­ one flare” from testicular Leydig cells. After 1 week of therapy, GnRH receptors are downregulated on the gonadotropin-producing cells, caus­ ing a decline in the pituitary response. The fall in serum LH leads to a decrease in testosterone production to castrate levels within 3 to 4 weeks of the first treatment. Subsequent treatments maintain testosterone at castrate levels. ADME GnRH agonists are administered as an injection once a month or every 3, 4, or 6 months. There is in an initial rise in LH and FSH levels, but after 14 to 21 days of therapy, a sustained decrease in serum LH and estrogen in women, or testosterone in men, is observed. Therapeutic Use in Breast and Prostate Cancer.   In the adjuvant setting, studies have demonstrated a further reduction in the risk of recurrence when GnRH agonists are given in conjunction with either AIs or  tamoxifen , when compared to  tamoxifen  alone, in very young or higher-risk premenopausal women (Pagani et al., 2020). In addition, these drugs can be given with  tamoxifen , AIs, or  fulvestrant  in premeno­ pausal women with metastatic breast cancer. In men with metastatic prostate cancer, ADT may be used in conjunction with chemotherapy (e.g.,  docetaxel ). Alternatively, ADT is typically combined with potent newer generation AR antagonists or the androgen synthesis inhibitor abiraterone   acetate  in what is referred to as “combined androgen block­ ade.” The advantage of combined androgen blockade is that the GnRH agonist (or GnRH antagonist) will deplete testicular androgens, while the competitive AR antagonist component competes at the AR with residual androgens made by the adrenal glands. When the steroid syn­ thesis inhibitor  abiraterone  is used for combined androgen blockade, there is a decrease in androgens made by the adrenal glands. Numer­ ous trials showed a benefit in survival in metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer following ADT combined with either  abiraterone  or docetaxel , but these treatments are associated with higher costs (and, in the case of  docetaxel , significantly higher toxicities) compared to ADT alone (Wang L et al., 2021). Toxicity Side effects in women are generally related to hypoestrogenism (i.e., hot flashes, vaginal dryness, decreased libido, osteoporosis, amenorrhea, and dyspareunia). The side effects of GnRH agonists are often reversible on cessation of therapy. AI use in premenopausal women combined with ovarian suppression with GnRH analogues increases menopausal symp­ toms and sexual dysfunction, and thus, benefits and risks should be care­ fully considered with each patient (Burstein et al., 2016). In men, during the transient rise in LH, the resultant testosterone surge or “flare” may induce acute stimulation of prostate cancer growth https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 1438 CHAPTER 73  HORMONES, HORMONE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS, AND RELATED AGENTS IN THE THERAPY OF CANCER Figure 73–1 A.  Targets of agents that interrupt estrogen receptor signaling in females.  GnRH promotes the release of LH and FSH (Figure 46–1), which regulate ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone and can stimulate estrogen production. Aromatase converts the estrogen precursors androstenedione, dihy­ droepiandrostenedione, and testosterone to estrogens (see Figures 48–1 and 48–2). Estrogen signaling can be interrupted by inhibiting hormone production (GnRH analogues, aromatase inhibitors), by antagonizing the effects of estrogen at the estrogen receptor (ER) with a SERM, or by destabilizing the ER and promoting its degradation with a SERD (e.g.,  fulvestrant ). The effects of SERMs (e.g.,  tamoxifen ) on organs are dependent on a number of factors including the activity and relative expression levels of transcriptional coactivators (CoA) and corepressors (CoR) in a particular tissue. In the breast,  tamoxifen  is an antagonist; a corepressor effect on gene transcription predominates. On the other hand, in the uterus,  tamoxifen  can drive estrogenic effects, after binding ER, by utilizing coactivators of gene transcription.  B.   Targets of agents that interrupt androgen receptor signaling in males.  GnRH promotes the release of LH and FSH, which stimulates adrenal and testicular androgen production. GnRH receptors can be inhibited by long-acting GnRH analogues that downregulate GnRH receptors or by GnRH antagonists.  Abiraterone acetate  is a steroid synthesis inhibitor that blocks the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to androgen precursors. Androgen signaling is inhibited by androgen receptor (AR) antagonists (e.g.,  enzalutamide ), which competitively bind the AR and inhibit binding and activation by androgens, particularly dihydrotestosterone (DHT). AR bound to  enzalutamide  (instead of DHT) has diminished interaction with coactivators and androgen response elements (AREs) on DNA. – – + LH, FSH GnRH Aromatase Inhibitors GnRH Analogs Androgens Estrogen ER agonist estrogen SERM tamoxifen SERD fulvestrant CoA CoA ERE uterus Estrogen Receptor Degradation + + CoA CoA ERE + breast ERE CoR CoR ER ER A + LH, FSH GnRH 5 α  reductase Inhibitors GnRH Analogs B abiraterone GnRH Antagonists Testosterone DHT AR agonist DHT antagonist enzalutamide CoA CoA ARE + ARE 1439 PHARMACOTHERAPY OF NEOPLASTIC DISEASE SECTION VIII and symptoms from stimulation of metastatic deposits in bone. Patients may experience an increase in bone pain, spinal cord compression, or obstructive bladder symptoms lasting for 2 to 3 weeks. The flare phe­ nomenon can be effectively counteracted with concurrent administra­ tion of 2 to 4 weeks of oral AR antagonist therapy, which may inhibit the action of the increased serum testosterone levels.

[10] itly improve performance, have not been convincingly demonstrated to have such a differential effect in human beings. Citing potentially serious health risks, the FDA has recommended against the use of body-building products that are marketed as containing steroids or steroid-like substances (FDA, 2017a, 2017b). Transdermal Delivery Systems To avoid the “first-pass” inactivation of testosterone by the liver, chem­ icals called excipients are used to facilitate the absorption of native tes­ tosterone across the skin in a controlled fashion. These transdermal preparations provide more stable serum testosterone concentrations than do injections of testosterone esters. Available preparations include gels or a solution applied to the skin or nasal mucosa, a transdermal patch, and a buccal tablet (see Figure 49–5). Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators Attempts have been made to develop selective nonsteroidal AR modu­ lators that exhibit desirable effects of testosterone in some tissues (such as muscle and bone) without the undesirable effects in other tissues, such as prostate. Some molecules with these properties have been developed and have been tested in humans, but unlike selective estro­ gen receptor modulators (see Chapter 48), none is currently available for clinical use. Therapeutic Uses of Androgens Male Hypogonadism The best-established indication for administration of androgens is testos­ terone replacement of testosterone deficiency in men. Any of the testos­ terone preparations or testosterone esters described can be used to treat testosterone deficiency.

Therefore, measuring the serum testosterone concentration during treat­ ment is the most important aspect of monitoring testosterone treatment for efficacy. With testosterone gels, the serum testosterone concentration is relatively constant from one application to the next (Swerdloff et al., 2000). When the enanthate or cypionate ester of testosterone is adminis­ tered once every 2 weeks, the serum testosterone concentration measured midway between doses should be normal; if not, the dosage schedule should be adjusted accordingly. If testosterone deficiency results from testicular disease, as indicated by an elevated serum LH concentration, adequacy of testosterone treatment also can be judged indirectly by the normalization of LH within 2 months of treatment initiation (Snyder and Lawrence, 1980). Normalization of the serum testosterone concentration induces nor­ mal virilization in prepubertal boys and restores virilization in adult men who became hypogonadal as adults. Within a few months, and often sooner, libido, energy, and hemoglobin return to normal. Within 6 months, muscle mass increases and fat mass decreases. Bone density and trabecular connectivity, however, continue to increase for 2 years (Al Mukaddam et al., 2014; Snyder et al., 2000). Monitoring for Deleterious Effects Testosterone administered by itself as a transdermal preparation has no “side effects” (i.e., no effects that endogenously secreted testosterone does not have), as long as the dose is not excessive. Some of these undesir­ able effects occur shortly after testosterone administration is initiated, whereas others usually do not occur until administration has been con­ tinued for many years. Raising the serum testosterone concentration can result in undesirable effects similar to those that occur during puberty, including acne, gynecomastia, and more aggressive sexual behavior. Physiological amounts of testosterone do not appear to affect serum lip­ ids or apolipoproteins. Replacement of physiological levels of testosterone occasionally has undesirable effects in the presence of concomitant illnesses. If the testos­ terone dose is excessive, erythrocytosis and, uncommonly, salt and water retention and peripheral edema occur even in men who have no predis­ position to these conditions. When a man is more than 40 years of age, he is subject to certain testosterone-dependent diseases, including benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. Modified testosterones, such as the 17α-alkylated androgens, do have side effects even when the doses are targeted to be physiologic. The principal side effects are hepatic, including cholestasis and, uncommonly, peliosis hepatitis, blood-filled hepatic cysts. Hepa­ tocellular cancer has been reported rarely. Additionally, they may lower serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, especially at large doses. Monitoring at the Anticipated Time of Puberty Testosterone accelerates epiphyseal maturation, leading initially to a growth spurt but then to epiphyseal closure and permanent cessation of linear growth. Consequently, the height and growth hormone status of the boy being treated must be considered. Boys who are short because of growth hormone deficiency should be treated with growth hormone before their hypogonadism is treated with testosterone. Male Senescence Serum testosterone levels decrease as men age, and the parallels between the consequences of aging and those of hypogonadism due to pituitary or testicular disease, such as decreases in sexual function, bone density, and hemoglobin, suggest the possibility that the decrease in testosterone with aging may contribute to these changes of aging. A study of 788 men 65 years or older with low testosterone concentrations demonstrated that testoster­ one treatment for 1 year, compared to placebo, improved sexual function, mood, depressive symptoms, anemia, and bone density and strength (Roy et al., 2017; Snyder et al., 2016, 2017). Testosterone replacement, however, did not improve cognitive function or glucose or lipid metabolism. No studies to date have been large enough or long enough to determine whether testosterone treatment of older men will increase the risk of pros­ — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

Actions of Estrogen and Progesterone The physiologic actions of estrogen and progesterone are summarized in  Tables 10.2  and  10.3 . In general, the two ovarian steroid hormones function in a coordinated fashion to support reproductive activity of the female including development of the ovum, development and maintenance of the corpus luteum to sustain a fertilized ovum, maintenance of pregnancy, and preparation of the breasts for lactation. Usually, estrogen and progesterone complement or enhance each other’s actions in the female reproductive tract. Occasionally, they antagonize or modulate each other’s actions. Over the course of the menstrual cycle, estrogen secretion by the ovaries precedes progesterone secretion, preparing the target tissues to respond to progesterone. An example of this “preparation” is seen in the up-regulation of progesterone receptors by estro- gen in several target tissues. Without estrogen and its up-regulatory action, progesterone has little biologic activity. Conversely, progesterone down-regulates estrogen receptors in some target tissues, decreasing their responsiveness to estrogen. 476    •    Physiology changes and events of a 28-day menstrual cycle are illustrated in  Figure 10.10  and described in the follow- ing steps.  By convention, day 0 marks the onset of menses from the previous cycle. 1.	  Follicular or proliferative phase.  The follicular phase occurs from day 0 until day 14. During this period, a primordial follicle develops into a graafian follicle and neighboring follicles become atretic (degenerate or regress). After the neighboring follicles degenerate, the remaining follicle is called the  domi- nant follicle.  Early in the follicular phase, receptors for FSH and LH are up-regulated in ovarian theca and granulosa cells and the gonadotropins stimulate the synthesis of estradiol. The follicular phase is dominated by  17 β -estradiol,  whose levels steadily increase. The high levels of estradiol cause prolifera- tion of the endometrial lining of the uterus and inhibit GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary by negative feedback (see  Fig. 10.9 ). 2.	  Ovulation.  Ovulation occurs on day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. Regardless of cycle length, ovula- tion typically occurs  14 days prior to menses.  For example, in a 35-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 21, or 14 days before menses; in a 24-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 10. Ovulation follows a burst of estradiol secretion at the end of the follicular phase: The burst of estradiol has a positive feedback effect on GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary (called the FSH and LH surge). The  FSH and LH surge  then causes ovulation of the mature ovum. At ovulation, cervical mucus increases in quantity and becomes watery and more penetrable by sperm. Estradiol levels decrease just after ovulation, but they will increase again during the luteal phase. 3.	  Luteal or secretory phase.  The luteal phase occurs from days 14–28, ending with the onset of menses. During the luteal phase, the corpus luteum develops and begins synthesizing estradiol and progesterone. The high levels of  progesterone  during this phase stimulate secretory activity of the endometrium and increase its vascularity. Thus in the follicular phase, estradiol causes the endometrial lining to proliferate; in the luteal phase, progesterone is preparing the endometrium to receive a fertilized ovum. Basal body temperature increases during the luteal phase because progesterone increases the hypothalamic temperature set point. The cervical mucus becomes less abundant and thicker, and it is now “too late” for sperm to fertilize the ovum. Late in the luteal phase, if fertilization has not occurred, the corpus luteum regresses. With this regression, the luteal source of estradiol and progesterone is lost, and blood levels of the hormones decrease abruptly. passed, the cervical mucus need not be penetrable by sperm.) Breasts Development of adult breasts is absolutely dependent on estrogen. The breasts, or mammary glands, are composed of lobular ducts lined by a milk-secreting epithelium. Small ducts converge and empty into larger ducts that converge at the nipple. These glandular structures are embedded in adipose tissue. At puberty, with the onset of estrogen secretion, the lobular ducts grow and the area around the nipple, the areola, enlarges. Estrogen also increases the amount of adipose tissue, giving the breasts their characteristic female shape. Progesterone collaborates with estrogen by stimulating secretory activity in the mammary ducts. Pregnancy The highest levels of estrogen and progesterone occur during pregnancy, synthesized in early pregnancy by the corpus luteum and in mid-to-late pregnancy by the placenta. Both estrogen and progesterone have multiple roles in pregnancy. Estrogen stimulates growth of the myometrium, growth of the ductal system of the breasts, prolactin secretion, and enlargement of the external genitalia. Progesterone maintains the endometrial lining of the uterus and increases the uterine threshold to contractile stimuli, thus preserving the pregnancy until the fetus is ready to be delivered. Other Actions of Estrogen and Progesterone In addition to those actions previously discussed, estrogen contributes to the pubertal growth spurt, closure of the epiphyses at the end of the growth spurt, and the deposition of subcutaneous fat (i.e., female fat distribution). Progesterone has a mild thermogenic action, which increases basal body temperature during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This increase in basal body temperature during the luteal phase is the basis for the “rhythm” method of contraception, in which the increase in temperature can be used retro- spectively to determine the time of ovulation. Events of the Menstrual Cycle The menstrual cycle recurs approximately every 28 days over the reproductive period of the female: from puberty until menopause. The events of the cycle include development of an ovarian follicle and its oocyte, ovulation, preparation of the reproductive tract to receive the fertilized ovum, and shedding of the endometrial lining if fertilization does not occur. — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 10 Reproductive Physiology, Female Reproductive Physiology, Halaman 479, 478

Gonadal sex is defined by the presence of testes or ovaries. Phenotypic sex is determined by the hormonal output of the gonads. ■	  Puberty in males and females is initiated by the pulsatile secretion of GnRH, which drives the pulsa- tile secretion of FSH and LH. Pulsatile secretion of FSH and LH drives the testes and ovaries to secrete their respective sex steroid hormones (testosterone and progesterone and estrogen). ■	  In males, the testes are responsible for spermatogen- esis and secretion of testosterone. Testosterone is synthesized from cholesterol by the Leydig cells. In some target tissues, testosterone must be converted to dihydrotestosterone by the action of 5 α -reductase. Testosterone acts locally to support spermatogenesis, as well as on extratesticular target tissues such as skeletal muscle. ■	  Regulation of the testes is via negative feedback effects of testosterone and inhibin on the hypothala- mus and anterior pituitary. ■	  In females, the ovaries are responsible for oogenesis and secretion of progesterone and estrogen. Proges- terone and 17 β -estradiol are synthesized from cho- lesterol by theca and granulosa cells, respectively. Theca cells synthesize progesterone and testosterone, and granulosa cells convert testosterone to 17 β - estradiol by the action of aromatase. ■	  The menstrual cycle has a follicular (proliferative) phase and a luteal (secretory) phase. The follicular phase is dominated by estrogen, and the luteal phase is dominated by progesterone. Ovulation occurs on day 15 of a 28-day menstrual cycle. If fertilization occurs, the corpus luteum synthesizes steroid hor- mones to support the developing zygote. If fertiliza- tion does not occur, the corpus luteum regresses and menses occurs. ■	  Early pregnancy is supported by steroid hormones produced by the corpus luteum, as directed by HCG from the trophoblast. The second and third trimes- ters of pregnancy are supported by steroid hormones from the placenta. Progesterone, estriol, and prolac- tin levels increase steadily during pregnancy. ■	  Menopause is the cessation of menstrual cycles. During this period, the number of functioning ovarian follicles decreases, estrogen secretion declines, and the circulating levels and pulsatility of FSH and LH secretion increase. when estrogen and progesterone levels fall precipi- tously, their inhibitory effects on the breast are removed and lactation can proceed. As described in Chapter 9, lactation is maintained by suckling, which stimulates the secretion of both oxytocin and prolactin. As long as lactation continues, there is  suppression of ovulation  because prolactin inhibits GnRH secre- tion by the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary. Although not 100% effec- tive, breast-feeding is a de facto method of contra- ception and family spacing in some regions of the world. Hormonal Contraception Oral contraceptives  contain combinations of estrogen and progesterone or progesterone alone. The combina- tion preparations exert contraceptive effects primarily through negative feedback effects on the anterior pituitary (i.e., by inhibiting FSH and LH secretion, they prevent ovulation). The combination preparations also reduce fertility by changing the character of the cervical mucus so that it is hostile to penetration by sperm and by decreasing the motility of the fallopian tubes. The contraceptive effect of progesterone alone is based primarily on its effects on cervical mucus and tubal motility. Higher-dose preparations of estrogen and progester- one inhibit ovulation and may interfere with implanta- tion; these preparations can be used as  postcoital contraceptives,  or “morning after” pills. Menopause Menopause, or the climacteric, is the cessation of menstrual cycles in women, and it occurs at approxi- mately 50 years of age. For several years preceding menopause, anovulatory cycles (menstrual cycles in which ovulation does not occur) become more common and the number of functioning ovarian follicles decreases. Accordingly, estrogen secretion gradually declines and eventually ceases. Because of the decreased level of estrogen, there is reduced negative feedback on the anterior pituitary and, accordingly, increased secre- tion and pulsatility of FSH and LH at menopause. The symptoms of menopause are caused by the loss of the ovarian source of estrogen and include thinning of the vaginal epithelium, decreased vaginal secretions, decreased breast mass, accelerated bone loss, vascular instability (“hot flashes”), and emotional lability. (Because estrogen can be produced from androgenic precursors in adipose tissue, obese women tend to be less symptomatic than nonobese women.)  Estrogen replacement therapy  is aimed at replacing the ovarian source of estrogen, thus minimizing or preventing the symptoms of menopause. 482    •    Physiology Challenge Yourself Answer each question with a word, phrase, sentence, or numerical solution.

Administration of gonadotropic hormones, which stimulate the Leydig cells of the newborn child’s testes to produce testosterone, can also cause the testes to descend. Thus, the stimulus for descent of the testes is testosterone, indicating again that testosterone is an important hor­ mone for male sexual development during fetal life. Effect of Testosterone on Development of Adult Primary and Secondary Sexual Characteristics After puberty, increasing amounts of testosterone secre­ tion cause the penis, scrotum, and testes to enlarge about eightfold before the age of 20 years. In addition, testos­ terone causes the secondary sexual characteristics of the male to develop, beginning at puberty and ending at maturity. These secondary sexual characteristics, in addi­ tion to the sexual organs, distinguish the male from the female as follows. Effect on the Distribution of Body Hair.  Testosterone causes growth of hair (1) over the pubis, (2) upward along the linea alba of the abdomen sometimes to the umbilicus and above, (3) on the face, (4) usually on the chest, and (5) less often on other regions of the body, such as the back. It also causes the hair on most other portions of the body to become more prolific. Male Pattern Baldness.  Testosterone decreases the growth of hair on the top of the head; a man who does not have functional testes does not become bald. However, many virile men never become bald because baldness is a result of two factors: first, a  genetic background  for the development of baldness and, second, superimposed on this genetic background,  large quantities of androgenic hormones . When a long-­sustained androgenic tumor de­ velops in a woman who has the appropriate genetic back­ ground, she becomes bald in the same manner as does a man. Effect on the Voice.  Testosterone secreted by the testes or injected into the body causes hypertrophy of the laryn­ geal mucosa and enlargement of the larynx. The effects at first cause a relatively discordant, “cracking” voice that gradually changes into the typical adult masculine voice. Testosterone Increases Thickness of the Skin and Can Contribute to Development of Acne.  Testosterone in­ creases the thickness of the skin over the entire body and the ruggedness of the subcutaneous tissues. Testosterone also increases the rate of secretion by some or perhaps all of the body’s sebaceous glands. Especially important is excessive secretion by the sebaceous glands of the face, which can result in  acne.  Therefore, acne is one of the most common features of male adolescence when the body is first becoming introduced to increased testoster­ one. After several years of testosterone secretion, the skin normally adapts to the testosterone in a way that allows it to overcome the acne. Testosterone Increases Protein Formation and Muscle Development.  One of the most important male charac­ teristics is development of increasing musculature after puberty, averaging about a 50% increase in muscle mass over that in the female. This increase in muscle mass is also associated with increased protein in the nonmuscle parts of the body. Many of the changes in the skin are due to deposition of proteins in the skin, and changes in the voice also result partly from this protein anabolic function of testosterone. Because of the great effect that testosterone and other androgens have on the body’s musculature, synthetic androgens are widely used by athletes to improve their muscular performance. This practice is to be severely deprecated because of prolonged harmful effects of excess androgens, as discussed in  Chapter 85  in relation to sports physiology. Testosterone or synthetic androgens are also occasionally used in old age as a “youth hormone” to improve muscle strength and vigor, but with ques­ tionable results. Some studies suggest that testosterone replacement therapy in elderly men may increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events. Testosterone Increases Bone Matrix and Causes Calci­ um Retention.  After the great increase in circulating tes­ tosterone that occurs at puberty (or after prolonged injec­ tion of testosterone), the bones grow considerably thicker and deposit considerable additional calcium salts. Thus, testosterone increases the total quantity of bone matrix and causes calcium retention. The increase in bone ma­ trix is believed to result from the general protein anabolic function of testosterone plus deposition of calcium salts in response to the increased protein. Testosterone has a specific effect on the pelvis to (1) narrow the pelvic outlet, (2) lengthen it, (3) cause a funnel-­like shape instead of the broad ovoid shape of the female pelvis, and (4) greatly increase the strength of the entire pelvis for load bearing. In the absence of testoster­ one, the male pelvis develops into a pelvis that is similar to that of the female. Because of the ability of testosterone to increase the size and strength of bones, it is sometimes used in older men to treat osteoporosis. When great quantities of testosterone (or any other androgen) are secreted abnormally in the still-­growing child, the rate of bone growth increases markedly, caus­ ing a spurt in total body height. However, the testosterone also causes the epiphyses of the long bones to unite with the shafts of the bones at an early age. Therefore, despite the rapidity of growth, this early uniting of the epiphyses prevents the person from growing as tall as he would have — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 81 - Reproductive and Hormonal Functions of the Male (and Function of the Pineal Gland), Stages of the Male Sexual Act, Halaman 966, 967
[14] terone. The full effect of this suppression may take up to 6 to 9 months. GnRH agonists downregulate gonadotropin secretion and also may be used to suppress ovarian steroid production. In patients who fail to respond to ovarian suppression, efforts to block androgen action may be effective.  Spironolactone , a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and  flutamide  (see Chapter 49) inhibit the androgen receptor. In Europe and elsewhere,  cyproterone  (50–100 mg/day) is used as an androgen receptor blocker, often in conjunction with a combina­ tion oral contraceptive.  Finasteride , an inhibitor of the type 2 isozyme of 5α-reductase that blocks the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotes­ tosterone, also is effective. Male offspring of women who become preg­ nant while taking any of these androgen inhibitors are at risk of impaired virilization secondary to impaired synthesis or action of dihydrotestos­ terone (fetal risk; contraindicated in pregnancy). The antifungal  keto­ conazole , which inhibits CYP steroid hydroxylases (see Chapters 50 and 985 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY 61), also can block androgen biosynthesis but may cause liver toxicity. Topical  eflornithine , an ornithine decarboxylase inhibitor, has been used with some success to decrease the rate of facial hair growth. Nonpharmacological approaches include bleaching, depilatory treat­ ments (e.g., shaving, treatment with hair-removing chemicals), or meth­ ods that remove the entire hair follicle (e.g., plucking, electrolysis, laser ablation). Gender Transition In the past 10 to 20 years, sex steroids have been used more frequently in transgender patients. Because no significant clinical trials have been performed, a great deal of variability exists in the approaches taken in both male-to-female and female-to-male transgender patients. In gen­ eral, younger patients in their early teens are often held from natural puberty through the use of GnRH agonists until the individuals are old and mature enough to be certain of their decision. Once the decision is made, whether the patients are younger or older, the approaches can be myriad, although they follow the same principles: (1) suppress endoge­ nous sex steroid production and (2) promote physical and mental fea­ tures of the desired gender. Male-to-Female Transitions The primary medication used for male-to-female transition is some form of estrogen, whether it be oral  estradiol  (2–6 mg/day), transdermal estradiol  (0.1–0.4 mg every 24 h), or injectable estrogens such as estradiol valerate  or  estradiol cypionate  (5–10 mg IM every 2 weeks). Side effects with estrogens, including thrombosis and breast cancer (not really established in male-to-female transgender patients), must be discussed with patients. Target serum estradiol levels are usually in the range of 100 to 200 pg/mL. In many patients, estrogen treatment alone will be sufficient to suppress endogenous androgen production and therefore androgen-mediated effects; however, in patients in whom this is not pos­ sible, antiandrogens such as  spironolactone  (100–400 mg/d) can be used. Alternatively, endogenous androgen production can be suppressed with GnRH agonists. The advantage of using antiandrogens or GnRH agonists is that the dosages of  estradiol  can often be significantly lower. Female-to-Male Transitions The primary medication used in female-to-male transitions is some form of androgen, whether it be injectable, such as  testosterone enanthate  or cypionate  (50–100 mg IM per week), or androgen gels (25–100 mg/day of testosterone). Target plasma androgen levels should be in the normal male range (300–500 mg/day). Side effects of excess androgens, including poly­ cythemia and lipid abnormalities, should be discussed and monitored with all patients. In general, these doses of androgens are sufficient to suppress endogenous ovarian steroid hormone production; however, if breakthrough uterine bleeding still occurs, patients can be treated with depot  medroxypro­ gesterone  (150 mg every 3 months) until bleeding no longer occurs. Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder Hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) is characterized by deficient or absent sexual fantasies and desire of sexual activity for an extended period of time that causes marked distress or interpersonal difficulty that cannot be attributed to a comorbid medical condition, problems in the relationship, or a drug or substance side effect. As the underlying cause of decreased sexual desire may be multifactorial, an appropriate treat­ ment plan for HSDD may include interventions that target psychosocial, behavioral, and biological causes, sex therapy, and psychotherapy. Flibanserin , a centrally acting daily medication, is an FDA-approved therapy for generalized HSDD in premenopausal women.  Flibanserin  is a 5HT 1A  receptor agonist and a 5HT 2A  receptor antagonist, but the mech­ anism by which the drug improves sexual desire and related distress is not known.  Flibanserin  has been associated with severe hypotension and syncope when taken with alcohol, which should be avoided (USFDA, 2015/2019).  Bremelanotide , a self-administered injection 45 min prior to anticipated sexual activity, is another FDA-approved medication for the treatment of generalized HSDD in premenopausal women.  Bremel­ anotide  activates melanocortin receptors, but the mechanism by which it improves sexual desire and related distress is unknown. It is associated with nausea and increased blood pressure and is not recommended in women at high risk for cardiovascular disease (USFDA, 2019). Hormone therapy may benefit select postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women with vulvovaginal atrophy and/or dyspareunia will benefit from low-dose local vaginal estrogen therapy or a SERM such as  ospemifene (USFDA, 2019b) .  Surgically menopausal and postmenopausal women with HSDD who are low risk for cardiometabolic disease may benefit from short-term testosterone therapy that achieves blood concentrations of testosterone that approximate premenopausal physiological concentra­ tions (Davis et al., 2019). https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 986 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT Drug Facts for Your Personal Formulary:  Estrogens, Progestins, GnRH, Gonadotropins Drug Therapeutic Uses Major Toxicity and Clinical Pearls Estrogens Steroidal Estrogen and Derivatives Estradiol Estradiol valerate Estradiol cypionate Ethinyl estradiol Mestranol Estrone sulfate Nonsteroidal Compounds Diethylstilbestrol • Menopause hormone therapy • Components of oral contraceptives • Treatment of transgender individuals • Depending on the preparation, may be available for oral, parenteral, transdermal, or topical administration • Act via ERα and ERβ • Precaution: prescribe the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with treatment goals and risks for each individual patient • Increased risk of thromboembolism • Potencies of various oral preparations differ due to differences in first-pass metabolism Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators Tamoxifen • Treatment of breast cancer • Antiestrogenic, estrogenic, or mixed activity depending on tissue — Laurence L.

[15] eggs are retrieved and used for IVF. Exogenous progesterone is provided to promote a receptive endometrium, followed by embryo transfer at 3 to 5 days after fer­ tilization.  C.  Protocol for ovarian hyperstimulation in an IVF protocol using a GnRH antagonist. The cycle duration is shorter because the GnRH antagonist does not induce a transient flare of gonadotropin secretion that might disrupt the timing of the cycle, but many other elements of the cycle are analogous to those in  B . fertilized  in vitro  with sperm (IVF) or by intracytoplasmic sperm injec­ tion; one or two embryos then are transferred to the uterus 3 to 5 days after fertilization or are cryopreserved for a frozen embryo transfer. Because of the inhibitory effects of GnRH agonists or antagonists on pituitary gonadotropes, the secretion of LH that normally sustains the corpus luteum after ovulation does not occur. Repeated injections of cho­ riogonadotropin, while sustaining the corpus luteum, may increase the risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Thus, standard IVF regi­ mens typically provide exogenous progesterone replacement to support the fetus until the placenta acquires the biosynthetic capacity to take over this function; regimens include progesterone in oil (50–100 mg/day intramus­ cularly) or micronized progesterone (180–300 mg twice daily vaginally). Vaginal preparations containing 100 or 90 mg of micronized progesterone are approved for administration two or three times daily as part of IVF. Aside from the attendant complications of multifetal gestation, the major side effect of gonadotropin treatment is OHSS. This potentially life-threatening event is believed to result from increased ovarian secre­ tion of substances that increase vascular permeability and is characterized by rapid accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, thorax, and even the pericardium. Symptoms and signs include abdominal pain or dis­ tention, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, dyspnea, oliguria, and marked ovarian enlargement on ultrasonography. OHSS can lead to hypovolemia, electrolyte abnormalities, acute respiratory distress syndrome, thrombo­ embolic events, and hepatic dysfunction. In an effort to minimize OHSS in at-risk patients, the FSH can be with­ held for a day or two (“coasting”). The rationale for this approach is that larger follicles become relatively gonadotropin independent and thus will continue to mature, while the smaller follicles undergo atresia in response to gonadotropin deprivation. Alternatively, an endogenous LH surge can be induced with a GnRH agonist during a GnRH antagonist short proto­ col, which nearly eliminates the incidence of OHSS by avoiding the use of choriogonadotropin to trigger oocyte maturation. The potential deleterious effects of gonadotropins are debated. Some studies have suggested that gonadotropins are associated with an increased risk of ovarian cancer, but this conclusion is controversial (Brinton et al., 2005). https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 980 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT Insulin Sensitizers Polycystic ovary syndrome affects 4% to 7% of women of reproductive age and is the most frequent cause of anovulatory infertility. Inasmuch as patients with PCOS often exhibit hyperinsulinemia and insulin resis­ tance, insulin sensitizers such as  metformin  have been evaluated for their effects on ovulation and fertility. Although several small trials suggested that  metformin  increased ovulation relative to placebo in patients with PCOS, a trial failed to demonstrate a significant effect of  metformin  on fertility (Legro et al., 2007);  metformin  was less effective than  clomiphene in inducing ovulation, promoting conception, or improving live birth rates, and there was no benefit of combining  metformin  with  clomiphene on live births, except possibly in women resistant to  clomiphene . Thus, except in women who exhibit glucose intolerance, the consensus is that metformin  generally should not be used for fertility induction in women with PCOS (Thessaloniki ESHRE/ASRM-Sponsored PCOS Consensus Workshop Group, 2008). Thiazolidinediones also have been evaluated for their ability to induce ovulation in patients with PCOS but are not used for this indication given an increased risk of congestive heart failure and myocardial ischemia. Drug Therapy in Obstetrics Pregnancy-Induced Hypertension/Preeclampsia Hypertension affects up to 10% of pregnant women in the U.S. Hyperten­ sion that precedes pregnancy or manifests before 20 weeks of gestation is believed to overlap considerably in pathogenesis with essential hyperten­ sion. These patients appear to be at increased risk for gestational diabetes and need careful monitoring. In contrast, pregnancy-induced hyperten­ sion, or preeclampsia, generally presents after 20 weeks of gestation as a new-onset hypertension with proteinuria (>300 mg of urinary protein/24 h); preeclampsia is thought to involve placenta-derived factors that affect vascular integrity and endothelial function in the mother, thus causing peripheral edema, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and in severe cases, seizures. Chronic hypertension is an established risk factor for preec­ lampsia. The consensus panel recommended initiation of drug therapy in women with a diastolic blood pressure greater than 105 mmHg or a systolic blood pressure greater than 160 mmHg. If severe preeclampsia ensues, with marked hypertension and evidence of end-organ damage, then termination of the pregnancy by delivery of the baby is the treat­ ment of choice, provided that the fetus is sufficiently mature to survive outside the uterus. If the baby is very preterm, then hospitalization and pharmacotherapy may be employed in an effort to permit further fetal maturation  in utero. Several drugs commonly used for hypertension in nonpregnant patients (e.g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists) should not be used in pregnant women due to unequivocal evidence of adverse fetal effects. Many experts will convert the patient to the centrally acting α adrenergic agonist  α-methyldopa (250 mg twice daily) (former FDA category B: no evidence of fetal risk in animal studies; no well-controlled studies in pregnant women), which rarely is used for hypertension in nonpregnant patients. Other drugs with reasonable evidence of safety also may be used, including the combination α 1 -selective, β-nonselective adrenergic antagonist labetalol  (100 mg twice daily) and the Ca 2+  channel blocker  nifedipine  (30 mg once daily). If severe preeclampsia or impending labor requires hospitalization, blood pressure can be controlled acutely with  hydralazine  (5 or 10 mg IV or IM, with repeated dosing at 20-min intervals depending on blood pressure response) or  labetalol  (20 mg IV, with dose escalation to 40 mg at 10 min if blood pressure control is inadequate).

[16] males deficient in CYP19 or the estrogen receptor, the epiphyses do not fuse, and long-bone growth continues indefinitely; such patients are also osteoporotic. Administration of estradiol corrects the bone abnormalities in patients with aromatase deficiency but not in those with an estrogen- receptor defect. Because men have larger bones than women, and bone expresses the AR (Colvard et al., 1989), testosterone also may act on bone via the AR. Administration of estradiol to a male with CYP19 deficiency can increase libido, suggesting that the effect of testosterone on male libido may be mediated by conversion to estradiol (Smith et al., 1994). Suppression of testosterone production with a GnRH analogue and then replacing testosterone with or without  anastrozole , an inhibitor of CYP19, also illustrates effects of testosterone that require conversion to estradiol. This paradigm demonstrated that the increase in sexual desire and erectile function and decrease in subcutaneous and abdominal fat require conversion of testosterone to estradiol but that the increase in lean mass and muscle strength do not (Finkelstein et al., 2013). Effects of Androgens at Different Stages of Life In Utero When the fetal testes, stimulated by hCG, begin to secrete testosterone at about the eighth week of gestation, the high local concentration of tes­ tosterone around the testes stimulates the nearby Wolffian ducts to dif­ ferentiate into the male internal genitalia: the epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles. In the anlage of the external genitalia, testosterone is converted to dihydrotestosterone, which causes the development of the male external genitalia. The increase in testosterone at the end of gesta­ tion may result in further phallic growth. Infancy The consequences of the increase in testosterone secretion by the testes during the first few months of life are not yet known. Puberty Puberty in the male begins at a mean age of 12 years with an increase in the secretion of FSH and LH from the gonadotrophs, stimulated by increased secretion of GnRH from the hypothalamus. The increased secre­ tion of FSH and LH stimulates the testes. The increase in testosterone pro­ duction by Leydig cells and the effect of FSH on the Sertoli cells stimulate the development of the seminiferous tubules, which eventually produce mature sperm. Increased secretion of testosterone into the systemic circu­ lation affects many tissues simultaneously; the changes in most tissue occur gradually over the course of several years. The phallus enlarges in length and width, the scrotum becomes rugate, and the prostate begins secreting the fluid it contributes to the semen. The skin becomes coarser and oilier TESTOSTERONE (aromatase) CYP19 5 α -reductase Dihydrotestosterone External Genitalia differentiation during gestation maturation during puberty adulthood prostatic diseases Internal Genitalia Wolffian development during gestation Bone epiphyseal closure increased density Libido Skeletal Muscle increased mass and strength during puberty Erythropoiesis Bone growth Hair Follicles: increased growth during puberty Estradiol Estrogen Receptor Androgen Receptor Androgen Receptor Figure 49–4 Direct effects of testosterone and effects mediated indirectly via dihydrotestosterone or estradiol. https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 994 CHAPTER 49  ANDROGENS AND THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT due to increased sebum production, which contributes to the development of acne. Male differential sexual hair begins to grow, initially pubic and axil­ lary hair, then hair on the lower legs, and finally other body hair and facial hair. Muscle mass and strength, especially of the shoulder girdle, increase, and subcutaneous fat decreases. Epiphyseal bone growth accelerates, result­ ing in the pubertal growth spurt, but epiphyseal maturation leads eventu­ ally to slowing and then cessation of growth. Bone also becomes thicker. Erythropoiesis increases, resulting in higher hematocrit and hemoglobin concentrations in men than boys or women. The larynx thickens, result­ ing in a lower voice. Libido develops. Other changes may result from the increase in testosterone during puberty; men tend to have a better sense of spatial relations than do women and to exhibit behavior that differs in some ways from that of women, including being more aggressive. Adulthood The serum testosterone concentration and the characteristics of the adult man are maintained largely during early adulthood and midlife. One change during this time is the gradual development of male pattern bald­ ness, beginning with recession of hair at the temples or at the vertex. Two other conditions are of great medical significance. One is benign prostatic hyperplasia , which occurs to a variable degree in almost all men, sometimes obstructing urine outflow by compressing the urethra as it passes through the prostate. This development is mediated by the conver­ sion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone by 5α-reductase II within pros­ tatic cells (Wilson, 1980). The other change is the development of  prostate cancer . Although no direct evidence suggests that testosterone causes the disease, prostate cancer depends on androgen stimulation. This depen­ dency is the basis of treating metastatic prostate cancer by lowering the serum testosterone concentration or by blocking its action at the receptor. Senescence As men age, the serum testosterone concentration gradually declines (see Figure 49–2), and the sex hormone–binding globulin concentration gradually increases, so that by age 80, the total testosterone concentration is about 80% and the free testosterone is about 40% of those at age 20 (Harman et al., 2001). This fall in serum testosterone probably results in several other changes that occur with increasing age in men, including decreases in libido, bone mineral density, and hemoglobin, as suggested by improvements in these parameters when testosterone is increased to normal levels for young men (see Therapeutic Uses of Androgens, below). Consequences of Androgen Deficiency The consequences of androgen deficiency depend on the stage of life dur­ ing which the deficiency first occurs and on the degree of the deficiency. During Fetal Development Testosterone deficiency in a male fetus during the first trimester in utero causes incomplete sexual differentiation. Complete deficiency of testosterone secretion results in entirely female external genitalia. Tes­ tosterone deficiency at this stage of development also leads to failure of the Wolffian ducts to differentiate into the male internal genitalia, but the Müllerian ducts do not differentiate into the female internal genitalia as long as testes are present and secrete Müllerian inhibitory substance. Similar changes occur if testosterone is secreted normally, but — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

U N I T  X I V 1045 In Chapters 81 and 82, the sexual functions of the male and female are described to the point of fertilization of the ovum. If the ovum becomes fertilized, a new sequence of events called  gestation  or  pregnancy  takes place, and the fertilized ovum eventually develops into a full-­term fetus. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the early stages of ovum development after fertilization and then to discuss the physiology of pregnancy. In  Chapter 84 , some special aspects of fetal and early childhood physiology are discussed. MATURATION AND FERTILIZATION OF THE OVUM While still in the ovary, the ovum is in the  primary oocyte stage. Shortly before it is released from the ovarian fol­ licle, its nucleus divides by meiosis and a  first polar body  is expelled from the nucleus of the oocyte (see  Figure 82-­3 ). The primary oocyte then becomes the  secondary oocyte. In this process, each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes loses one of its partners, which becomes incorporated in a polar body  that is expelled. This leaves 23  unpaired  chro­ mosomes in the secondary oocyte. It is at this time that the ovum, which is still in the secondary oocyte stage, is ovulated into the abdominal cavity. Then, almost imme­ diately, it enters the fimbriated end of one of the fallopian tubes. Entry of the Ovum Into the Fallopian Tube (Uterine Tube).  When ovulation occurs, the ovum, along with a hundred or more attached granulosa cells that constitute the  corona radiata,  is expelled directly into the peritoneal cavity and must then enter one of the fallopian tubes (also called  uterine tubes ) to reach the cavity of the uterus. The fimbriated ends of each fallopian tube fall naturally around the ovaries. The inner surfaces of the fimbriated tentacles are lined with ciliated epithelium, and the  cilia are activated by estrogen from the ovaries, which causes the cilia to beat toward the opening, or  ostium,  of the in­ volved fallopian tube. One can actually see a slow fluid current flowing toward the ostium. By this means, the ovum enters one of the fallopian tubes. Although one might suspect that many ova fail to enter the fallopian tubes, conception studies suggest that up to 98% of ova succeed in this task. Indeed, in some recorded cases, women with one ovary removed and the opposite fallopian tube removed have had sev­ eral children with relative ease of conception, thus dem­ onstrating that ova can even enter the opposite fallopian tube. Fertilization of the Ovum.  After the male ejaculates semen into the vagina during intercourse, a few sperm are transported within 5 to 10 minutes upward from the vagina and through the uterus and fallopian tubes to the ampullae  of the fallopian tubes near the ovarian ends of the tubes. This transport of the sperm is aided by contrac­ tions of the uterus and fallopian tubes stimulated by pros­ taglandins in the male seminal fluid and also by oxytocin released from the posterior pituitary gland of the female during her orgasm. Of the almost half a billion sperm de­ posited in the vagina, a few thousand succeed in reaching each ampulla. Fertilization of the ovum  ( Figure 83-­1 )  normally takes place in the ampulla of one of the fallopian tubes soon after both the sperm and the ovum enter the ampulla. Before a sperm can enter the ovum, however, it must first penetrate the multiple layers of granulosa cells attached to the outside of the ovum (the  corona radiata ) and then bind to and penetrate the  zona pellucida  surrounding the ovum. The mechanisms used by the sperm for these pur­ poses are presented in  Chapter 81 . Once a sperm has entered the ovum (which is still — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 83 - Pregnancy and Lactation, 82 - Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones, Maturation and Fertilization of the Ovum, Female Sexual Act, Halaman 989, 991, 990
[18] external male genitalia (e.g., penis, scrotum) requires dihydrotestosterone. Thus deficiency of 5 α -reductase meant that Jenny’s external genitalia were not normally developed. At puberty, the clitoris grew and became more like a penis because of the high-normal circulat- ing level of testosterone; apparently, with high enough levels, the androgen receptors that mediate growth of the external genitalia can be activated. Her voice deep- ened and she acquired skeletal muscle mass, actions that are mediated by testosterone and do not require conversion to dihydrotestosterone. Despite acquiring many masculine characteristics, Jenny did not develop body and facial hair because the hair follicles require dihydrotestosterone. Jenny did not develop breasts because she did not have ovaries, which in normal females are the source of the estrogen required for breast development. TREATMENT.   If Jenny chooses to continue life as a woman, it will be necessary to remove her testes, which are producing the testosterone that is causing her to be selectively masculinized (e.g., growth of penis, deepening of voice, muscle mass). In addition, because she lacks ovaries, Jenny has no endogenous source for the estrogen needed for breast development and female fat distribution; thus she would require treatment with supplemental estrogen. She may elect to have surgical correction of the introitus; however, even with the surgery, she will not be able to bear children because she lacks ovaries and an internal female genital tract. If Jenny chooses to live the rest of her life as a man, she will be treated with androgenic compounds that do not require 5 α -reduction for activity. The supplemental androgens will complete the masculinization process including development of male body and facial hair, sebaceous gland activity, growth of the prostate, and, in later life, male pattern baldness. 10—Reproductive Physiology    •    471 The  development of ovarian follicles  occurs in the following stages, which are illustrated in  Figure 10.7 : 1.	  First stage.  The first stage of follicular development parallels prophase of the oocyte. Thus the first stage of the ovarian follicle lasts many years. The shortest duration for the first stage is approximately 13 years (the approximate age at first ovulation); the longest duration is 50 years (the approximate age at meno- pause). As the primary oocyte grows, the granulosa cells proliferate and nurture the oocyte with nutrients and steroid hormones. During this stage, the primor- dial follicle develops into a  primary follicle,  theca interna cells develop, and granulosa cells begin to secrete fluid. No follicle progresses beyond this first stage in prepubertal ovaries. 2.	  Second stage.  The second stage of follicular devel- opment occurs much more rapidly than the first stage. This stage takes place over a period of 70–85 days and is present only during the reproductive period. During each menstrual cycle, a few follicles enter this sequence. A fluid containing steroid hor- mones, mucopolysaccharides, proteins, and FSH accumulates in a central area of the follicle called the antrum. The steroid hormones reach the antrum by direct secretion from granulosa cells. The granu- losa and theca cells continue to grow. At the end of the second stage, the follicle is called a  graafian follicle  and has an average diameter of 2–5 mm. 3.	  Third stage.  The third and final stage of follicular development is the most rapid, occurring 5–7 days after menses (menses marks the end of the previous cycle). A single graafian follicle achieves dominance over its cohorts, and the cohorts regress. Within 48 hours, the  dominant follicle  grows to 20 mm in diameter. On day 14 of a 28-day menstrual cycle, ovulation  occurs and the dominant follicle ruptures and releases its oocyte into the peritoneal cavity. At this time, the first meiotic division is completed and the resulting secondary oocyte enters the nearby fallopian tube, where it begins the second meiotic division. In the fallopian tube, if fertilization by a sperm occurs, the second meiotic division is completed, producing the haploid ovum with 23 chromosomes. The residual elements of the ruptured primary fol- licle form the  corpus luteum.  The corpus luteum is composed primarily of granulosa cells but also of theca cells, capillaries, and fibroblasts. The corpus luteum synthesizes and secretes steroid hormones, which are necessary for implantation and maintenance of the zygote should fertilization occur. If fertilization  does occur, the corpus luteum will secrete steroid hormones until the placenta assumes this role, later in pregnancy. If fertilization  does not occur,  the corpus luteum development of the ova. Systemically, the ovarian steroid hormones act on a variety of target tissues including uterus, breast, and bone. The functional unit of the ovaries is the  single ovarian follicle,  which comprises one germ cell sur- rounded by endocrine cells. When fully developed, the ovarian follicle serves several critical roles: It will provide nutrients for the developing oocyte; release the oocyte at the proper time (ovulation); prepare the vagina and fallopian tubes to aid in fertilization of the egg by a sperm; prepare the lining of the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg; and, in the event of fertilization, maintain steroid hormone production for the fetus until the placenta can assume this role. Oogenesis In the developing ovaries, primordial germ cells produce oogonia by mitotic divisions until gestational weeks 20–24. At that time, there are approximately 7 million oogonia. Beginning at gestational weeks 8–9, some of these oogonia enter the prophase of meiosis and become primary oocytes. The meiotic process continues until approximately 6 months after birth, at which point all oogonia have become oocytes. The oocytes remain in a state of suspended prophase; the first meiotic division will not be completed until ovulation occurs many years later. Simultaneously, there is attri- tion of oocytes. At birth, only 2 million oocytes remain; by puberty, only 400,000 oocytes remain; by menopause (which marks the end of the reproductive period), few, if any, oocytes remain. Whereas males continuously produce spermatogonia and spermatocytes, females do not produce new oogonia and function from a declining pool of oocytes.

[20] ing estrogen production (Figure 73–4). AIs are now considered the stan­ dard of care for adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer, either as initial therapy or after  tamoxifen  (Dowsett et al., 2010) as well as in higher-risk premenopausal women in combination with GnRH agonists. AIs are also approved in the initial treatment of metastatic ER+/PR+ breast cancer, often in combination with CDK4/6 inhibitors, in postmenopausal women and in combination with GnRH agonists in premenopausal women. Aromatase (CYP19A1) converts adrenal androgens and gonadal androstenedione and testosterone to the estrogens estrone (E1) and est­ radiol (E2), respectively (see Figures 73–3 and 73–4; reactions catalyzed by aromatase are noted by a green “A” beside the reaction arrow in Figure 73–4). In postmenopausal women, this conversion occurs in nonovarian tissues (fat, liver, muscle, brain, breast, and breast tumors) and is the pri­ mary source of circulating estrogens. In premenopausal women, estrogen is primarily produced in the ovaries. AIs increase gonadotropin produc­ tion in premenopausal women, which reduces their ability to inhibit ovarian estrogen production. As a result, AIs are not effective in premeno­ pausal women without additional ovarian suppression (e.g., with GnRH analogues; see previous section). In postmenopausal women, AIs suppress most peripheral aromatase activity, leading to profound estrogen depri­ vation. AIs are classified as first, second, or third generation. In addition, they are further classified as type 1 (steroidal) or type 2 (nonsteroidal) AIs according to their structure and mechanism of action (see Figure 73–3). Type 1 inhibitors are steroidal analogues of androstenedione that bind covalently and irreversibly to the same site on the aromatase molecule. Thus, they commonly are known as aromatase inactivators. Type 2 inhibi­ tors are nonsteroidal and bind reversibly to the heme group of the enzyme, producing reversible inhibition.

Third-generation AIs are used as part of the treatment of early-stage and advanced breast cancer in postmeno­ pausal women and for chemoprevention (see Table 73–1). The type 1 and 2 AIs have similar clinical efficacy and toxicity profiles (Goss et al., 2013), and these are summarized for AIs using  anastrozole  as a prototype. For letrozole  and  exemestane , additional drug-specific information is given. Daily administration of AIs (see dosages in Table 73–1) reduces total- body androgen aromatization by more than 95% after 1 month of treat­ ment. AIs also reduce aromatization within large ER+ breast tumors. Anastrozole.   Anastrozole  is a potent and selective triazole AI.  Anastrozole , like  letrozole , binds competitively and specifically to the heme of the CYP19. ADME.    Anastrozole  is absorbed rapidly after oral administration; food slows the rate but not the overall extent of absorption. Steady state is attained after 7 days of repeated dosing.  Anastrozole  is metabolized by hepatic  N -dealkylation, hydroxylation (CYP3A4 mainly), and glucu­ ronidation (UGT1A4); the main circulating metabolite of  anastrozole , triazole, is inactive. The hepatic metabolites account for 85% of the administered dose and are excreted via bile/feces; approximately 10% of the drug is excreted in the urine as the unmetabolized parent compound. The elimination  t 1/2  is approximately 50 h. The pharmacokinetics of B.

Therapeutic Uses.    AIs are approved for up-front adjuvant hormonal ther­ apy for 5 to 10 years or following prior  tamoxifen  in postmenopausal women with early-stage breast cancer and as treatment of advanced and metastatic breast cancer.

[21] in Schmidt et al., 2021). In an effort to overcome resistance to current antiandrogen therapies, studies are ongoing with a variety of new agents, including those that promote AR degradation such as PROTACs (Salami et al., 2018) and small-molecule receptor degraders (Mohler et al., 2021). Drugs That Inhibit Androgen Synthesis As discussed above ,  even in conditions of castration levels of circulat­ ing testosterone, persistent AR activity in CRPC cells may support tumor growth. Synthesis of extragonadal androgens occurs in the adrenal glands or CRPC tumors themselves (see Figure 73–4). Androstenedione, pro­ duced by the adrenal glands, is converted to testosterone and dihydrotes­ tosterone in peripheral tissues and prostate tumors. Intratumoral  de novo androgen synthesis also may provide sufficient androgen for AR-driven cell proliferation. Thus, inhibitors of androgen synthesis combined with ADT have proven useful in reducing AR signaling in CRPC. Abiraterone Acetate Abiraterone , with  prednisone , is used for the treatment of metastatic pros­ tate cancer in patients who are chemotherapy naïve or in those who have received previous  docetaxel . In both settings,  abiraterone  prolongs survival (reviewed in Paschalis and de Bono, 2020). The combination of  abiraterone and  prednisone , in conjunction with ADT, also prolongs overall survival in men with metastatic castration-sensitive prostate cancer (Virgo et al., 2021; Wang L et al., 2021). Resistance to  abiraterone , similar to that to  enzaluta­ mide , can occur through a variety of mechanisms mainly involving the AR (discussed above). AR antagonists and abiraterone in additional prostate cancer clinical settings is being evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. Mechanism of Action.   Abiraterone  is an irreversible inhibitor of 17α- hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase (CYP17A1) activity in testicular, adrenal, and prostatic cancer tissue (see Figure 73–3). Inhibition of CYP17A1 reduces the conversion of pregnenolone and progesterone to their 17α-OH deriv­ atives and their subsequent enzymatic conversion to dehydroepiandro­ sterone and androstenedione. Thus, circulating levels of testosterone drop to almost undetectable levels after  abiraterone  administration.  Abi­ raterone  also has some activity as an AR antagonist and inhibitor of other steroid synthetic enzymes and CYPs. Overall,  abiraterone  has greater potency and selectivity than  ketoconazole , which is described below. ADME.   Abiraterone is the active metabolite of  abiraterone   acetate . With continuous administration,  abiraterone  increases adrenocorticotropic hor­ mone levels, resulting in mineralocorticoid excess. Oral  abiraterone  acetate is administered with  prednisone  to counteract adrenal suppression.  Abi­ raterone  should be taken on an empty stomach due to the effect of food to increase both  C max  and AUC of the drug. Alternatively, the National Com­ prehensive Cancer Network lists low-dose  abiraterone  (250 mg/day) with a low-fat breakfast as an alternative treatment option to 1000 mg/day of abiraterone  taken on an empty stomach (Szmulewitz et al., 2018). https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 1446 CHAPTER 73  HORMONES, HORMONE RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS, AND RELATED AGENTS IN THE THERAPY OF CANCER Abiraterone  is metabolized by CYP3A4; thus, concomitant use of drugs that are strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.,  carbamazepine ,  rifampi­ cin , St. John’s wort, several reverse transcriptase inhibitors) should be avoided.  Abiraterone   acetate  inhibits the highly polymorphic CYP2D6 and CYP2C8; thus, concomitant use of drugs that are substrates of these CYPs (e.g., 2D6 substrates:  risperidone ,  metoprolol ,  nebivolol ,  imi­ pramine -based antidepressants,  fluoxetine ,  tamoxifen ,  codeine ,  hydroco­ done ,  oxycodone ,  tramadol ; 2C8 substrates:  amiodarone ,  carbamazepine , cerivastatin ,  diclofenac ,  ibuprofen ,  paclitaxel ,  rosiglitazone ) requires care­ ful monitoring for toxicity and possibly dose adjustment. Toxicity.   The most common side effects include fatigue, arthralgia, hypertension, nausea, edema, hypokalemia, hot flush, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract infection, cough, and headache. As was observed with enzalutamide in the same study, use of  abiraterone  is associated with an increased risk of short-term mortality in elderly men with pre­ existing cardiovascular comorbidities (Lu-Yao et al., 2020). Laboratory abnormalities that are most common include anemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, hypertriglyceridemia, lymphopenia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperglycemia, and hypokalemia. Ketoconazole Ketoconazole  is an antifungal agent that also inhibits both testicular and adrenal steroidogenesis by blocking CYP17 (17α-hydroxylase), CYP11A, and other P450 cytochrome enzymes.  Ketoconazole  can be administered off-label in conjunction with ADT to reduce adrenal androgen synthe­ sis in CRPC. Oral  ketoconazole  is coadministered with  hydrocortisone  to compensate for inhibition of adrenal steroidogenesis.  Ketoconazole  has limited use in practice due to its toxicity and inferiority compared to  abi­ raterone   acetate . Chapter 61 presents the basic and clinical pharmacology of the azoles. Prostate Cancer Chemoprevention (5α-Reductase Inhibitors) 5α-Reductase catalyzes the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, the most potent endogenous androgen. Two inhibitors of 5α-reductase, finasteride  and  dutasteride , have been studied for prostate cancer che­ moprevention. The results have been controversial: two clinical trials indicated decreased risk of low-grade prostate cancer but increased inci­ dence of high-grade disease in the drug treatment arms. However, lon­ ger-term follow-up and other studies (Goodman et al., 2019) revealed no elevated incidence for high-grade prostate cancer or mortality from prostate cancer in the  finasteride -treated subjects; the initial results in higher grade prostate cancer may have resulted from detection bias or may have been related to the study design (reviewed in Chau and Figg, 2018). Bipolar Androgen Deprivation Therapy Since CRPC typically becomes resistant to AR-directed therapies such as  enzalutamide  and  abiraterone , investigators have examined whether bipolar androgen deprivation therapy (BAT) might resensitize tumors to AR-directed drugs. With prolonged deprivation of stimulation by andro­ gens, prostate cancer cells may adapt via upregulation of the AR, thereby becoming resistant to treatment. BAT is rapid cycling between extremes of high and low (castrate) circulating testosterone in order to disrupt the process by which prostate cancer cells adapt to a low androgen milieu. A randomized study compared BAT versus  enzalutamide  in men with CRPC whose disease had progressed following  abiraterone . Although there was no significant difference between the treatment arms in terms of progression-free survival, BAT did improve the extent and duration of response in the crossover arm in which BAT was the intervening therapy between  abiraterone  and  enzalutamide . This study underscores the need to define optimal sequencing of BAT and different AR-targeted therapies (Denmeade et al., 2021).

[22] cyclical, with LH following fairly faithfully the pulsatile release of GnRH. In contrast, FSH secretion increases and decreases only slightly with each fluctuation of GnRH secretion; instead, it changes more slowly over a period of many hours in response to longer-­term changes in GnRH. Because of the much closer relation between GnRH secretion and LH secretion, GnRH is also widely known as  LH-­releasing hormone. Gonadotropic Hormones: Luteinizing Hormone and Follicle-­Stimulating Hormone Both of the gonadotropic hormones, LH and FSH, are secreted by the same cells, called  gonadotropes,  in the anterior pituitary gland. In the absence of GnRH secre­ tion from the hypothalamus, the gonadotropes in the pituitary gland secrete almost no LH or FSH. UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 1022 LH and FSH are  glycoproteins . They exert their effects on their target tissues in the testes mainly by  activating the cyclic adenosine monophosphate second messenger sys­ tem,  which in turn activates specific enzyme systems in the respective target cells. Regulation of Testosterone Production by Luteinizing Hormone.  Testosterone  is secreted by the  interstitial cells of Leydig  in the testes, but only when they are stimulated by LH from the anterior pituitary gland. Furthermore, the quantity of testosterone that is secreted increases ap­ proximately in direct proportion to the amount of LH that is available. Mature Leydig cells are normally found in a child’s tes­ tes for a few weeks after birth but then disappear until after the age of about 10 years. However, injection of purified LH into a child at any age or secretion of LH at puberty causes testicular interstitial cells that look like fibroblasts to evolve into functioning Leydig cells. Inhibition of Anterior Pituitary Secretion of Luteiniz­ ing and Follicle-­Stimulating Hormones by Testoster­ one—Negative Feedback Control of Testosterone Se­ cretion.  Testosterone secreted by the testes in response to LH has the reciprocal effect of inhibiting anterior pitui­ tary secretion of LH (see  Figure 81-­10 ). Most of this inhi­ bition probably results from a direct effect of testosterone on the hypothalamus to decrease secretion of GnRH. This effect in turn causes a corresponding decrease in secre­ tion of LH and FSH by the anterior pituitary, and the de­ crease in LH reduces secretion of testosterone by the tes­ tes. Thus, whenever testosterone secretion becomes too great, this automatic negative feedback effect, operating through the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary gland, reduces testosterone secretion back toward the desired operating level. Conversely, too little testosterone allows the hypothalamus to secrete large amounts of GnRH, with a corresponding increase in anterior pituitary LH and FSH secretion and consequent increase in testicular testosterone secretion. Regulation of Spermatogenesis by Follicle-­Stimulating Hormone and Testosterone FSH binds with specific FSH receptors attached to the Sertoli cells in the seminiferous tubules, which causes the Sertoli cells to grow and secrete various spermato­ genic substances. Simultaneously, testosterone (and dihydrotestosterone) diffusing into the seminiferous tubules from the Leydig cells in the interstitial spaces also has a strong tropic effect on spermatogenesis. Thus, both FSH and testosterone are necessary to initiate spermatogenesis. Role of Inhibin in Negative Feedback Control of Sem­ iniferous Tubule Activity.  When the seminiferous tu­ bules fail to produce sperm, secretion of FSH by the ante­ rior pituitary gland increases markedly. Conversely, when spermatogenesis proceeds too rapidly, pituitary secretion of FSH diminishes. The cause of this negative feedback effect on the anterior pituitary is believed to be secretion by the Sertoli cells of still another hormone called  inhibin (see  Figure 81-­10 ). This hormone has a strong direct ef­ fect on the anterior pituitary gland to inhibit FSH secre­ tion. Inhibin is a glycoprotein, like LH and FSH, with a molec­ ular weight between 10,000 and 30,000. It has been isolated from cultured Sertoli cells.

Chapter 81   Reproductive and Hormonal Functions of the Male (and Function of the Pineal Gland) 1023 U N I T  X I V the anterior pituitary gland provides an important negative feedback mechanism for control of spermatogenesis, oper­ ating simultaneously with and in parallel to the negative feedback mechanism for control of testosterone secretion. Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Secreted by the Placenta During Pregnancy Stimulates Testosterone Secretion by the Fetal Testes During pregnancy, the hormone  human chorionic gonad­ otropin  (hCG) is secreted by the placenta and circulates in the mother and in the fetus. This hormone has almost the same effects on the sexual organs as LH. During pregnancy, if the fetus is a male, hCG from the placenta causes the testes of the fetus to secrete testoster­ one. This testosterone is critical for promoting formation of the male sexual organs, as pointed out earlier. We dis­ cuss hCG and its functions during pregnancy in greater detail in  Chapter 83 . Puberty and Regulation of Its Onset Initiation of the onset of puberty has long been a mystery, but it has now been determined that  during childhood the hypothalamus does not secrete significant amounts of GnRH . One of the reasons for this is that, during child­ hood, the slightest secretion of any sex steroid hormones exerts a strong inhibitory effect on hypothalamic secre­ tion of GnRH. Yet, for reasons still not fully understood, at the time of puberty, the secretion of hypothalamic GnRH breaks through the childhood inhibition and adult sexual life begins. Male Adult Sexual Life and Male Climacteric .  After pu­ berty, gonadotropic hormones are produced by the male pituitary gland for the remainder of life, and at least some spermatogenesis usually continues until death. Many men, however, begin to exhibit slowly decreasing sexual func­ tions in their late 50s or 60s, especially if they smoke or are obese and have associated cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is considerable variation in the — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 81 - Reproductive and Hormonal Functions of the Male (and Function of the Pineal Gland), Stages of the Male Sexual Act, Halaman 969, 970, 968
[23] normal levels for young men (see Therapeutic Uses of Androgens, below). Consequences of Androgen Deficiency The consequences of androgen deficiency depend on the stage of life dur­ ing which the deficiency first occurs and on the degree of the deficiency. During Fetal Development Testosterone deficiency in a male fetus during the first trimester in utero causes incomplete sexual differentiation. Complete deficiency of testosterone secretion results in entirely female external genitalia. Tes­ tosterone deficiency at this stage of development also leads to failure of the Wolffian ducts to differentiate into the male internal genitalia, but the Müllerian ducts do not differentiate into the female internal genitalia as long as testes are present and secrete Müllerian inhibitory substance. Similar changes occur if testosterone is secreted normally, but its action is diminished because of an abnormality of the AR or of the 5α-reductase. Abnormalities of the AR can have quite varied effects. The most severe form results in complete absence of androgen action and a female phe­ notype; moderately severe forms result in partial virilization of the exter­ nal genitalia; and the mildest forms permit normal virilization in utero and result only in impaired spermatogenesis in adulthood (McPhaul and Griffin, 1999). Abnormal 5α-reductase results in incomplete viril­ ization of the external genitalia in utero but normal development of the male internal genitalia, which requires only testosterone (Wilson et al., 1993). Testosterone deficiency during the third trimester impairs phallus growth. The result, microphallus, is a common occurrence in boys later discovered to be unable to secrete LH due to abnormalities of GnRH secretion or action. In addition, with testosterone deficiency, the testes fail to descend into the scrotum; this condition, cryptorchidism, occurs commonly in boys whose LH secretion is subnormal (see Chapter 46). Before Completion of Puberty When a boy can secrete testosterone normally in utero but loses the capac­ ity to do so before the anticipated age of puberty, the result is failure to complete puberty. All the pubertal changes previously described, includ­ ing those of the external genitalia, sexual hair, muscle mass, voice, and behavior, are impaired to a degree proportionate to the abnormality of testosterone secretion. In addition, if growth hormone secretion is normal when testosterone secretion is subnormal during the years of expected puberty, the long bones continue to lengthen because the epiphyses do not close. The result is longer arms and legs relative to the trunk. Another con­ sequence of subnormal testosterone secretion during the age of expected puberty is enlargement of glandular breast tissue, called  gynecomastia . After Completion of Puberty When testosterone secretion becomes impaired after puberty (e.g., cas­ tration or antiandrogen treatment), regression of the pubertal effects of testosterone depends on both the degree and the duration of testoster­ one deficiency. When the degree of testosterone deficiency is substantial, libido and energy decrease within a week or two, but other testoster­ one-dependent characteristics decline more slowly. A clinically detect­ able decrease in muscle mass in an individual does not occur for several years. A pronounced decrease in hemoglobin will occur within several months. A decrease in bone mineral density can be detected within a year, but an increase in fracture incidence is not likely to occur for many years. Additionally, loss of sexual hair takes many years. In Women Loss of androgen secretion in women results in a decrease in sexual hair, but not for many years. Androgens may have other important effects in women, and the loss of androgens (especially with the severe loss of ovar­ ian and adrenal androgens that occurs in panhypopituitarism) may result in decreased libido, energy, muscle mass and strength, and bone mineral density. Therapeutic Androgen Preparations Ingestion of testosterone is not an effective means of replacing testoster­ one deficiency due to its rapid hepatic metabolism following intestinal absorption. Most pharmaceutical preparations of androgens, therefore, are designed to bypass hepatic metabolism of testosterone. Note that all FDA-approved testosterone,  methyltestosterone , and  oxandrolone products are Drug Enforcement Administration schedule III controlled substances. Testosterone Esters Esterifying a fatty acid to the 17α-hydroxyl group of testosterone cre­ ates a compound that is even more lipophilic than testosterone itself. When an ester, such as testosterone enanthate (heptanoate) or cypionate (cyclopentylpropionate) (Table 49–1), is dissolved in oil and adminis­ tered intramuscularly every 1 to 2 weeks to hypogonadal men, the ester hydrolyzes  in vivo  and results in serum testosterone concentrations that range from higher than normal in the first few days after the injection to low-normal just before the next injection (Figure 49–5). Attempts to decrease the frequency of injections by increasing the amount of each injection result in wider fluctuations and poorer therapeutic outcomes. The undecanoate ester of testosterone, when dissolved in oil and ingested orally, is absorbed into the lymphatic circulation, thus bypassing initial hepatic metabolism.  Testosterone undecanoate  in oil also can be injected and produces stable serum testosterone concentrations for 2 months. 995 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY Alkylated Androgens Several decades ago, chemists found that adding an alkyl group to the 17α position of testosterone retards its hepatic metabolism. Consequently, 17α-alkylated androgens can be administered orally. Table 49–1 lists 17α-alkylated androgens used clinically. However, 17α-alkylated androgens are less androgenic than testosterone and cause hepatotoxicity, whereas native testosterone does not. Some 17α-alkylated androgens show greater anabolic effects than andro­ genic effects compared to native testosterone in laboratory tests in rats; however, these “anabolic” steroids, so favored by athletes to illic­ itly improve performance, have not been convincingly demonstrated to have such a differential effect in human beings. Citing potentially serious health risks, the FDA has recommended against the use of body-building products that are marketed as containing steroids or steroid-like substances (FDA, 2017a, 2017b). Transdermal Delivery Systems To avoid the “first-pass” inactivation of testosterone by the liver, chem­ icals called excipients are used to facilitate the absorption of native tes­ tosterone across the skin in a controlled fashion. These transdermal preparations provide more stable serum testosterone concentrations than do injections of testosterone esters. Available preparations include gels or a solution applied to the skin or nasal mucosa, a transdermal patch, and a buccal tablet (see Figure 49–5). Selective Androgen Receptor Modulators — Laurence L.

[25] cancer growth was demonstrated in 1941 and led to the awarding of a Nobel Prize in 1966 to Dr. Charles Huggins. Huggins’s findings estab­ lished androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer, an approach still used today. ADT is accomplished by surgical castration (bilateral orchiectomy) or “medical” castration, using long-acting GnRH agonist formulations to downregulate GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary or with GnRH antagonists that directly block GnRH receptor-ligand interaction to achieve more rapid suppression of the major circulating androgen, tes­ tosterone (Table 73–2 and Figure 73–1B). ADT results in castrate levels (≤50 ng/dL) of testosterone and hence subsequent reduction of the testos­ terone metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, which binds with highest affinity to the androgen receptor (AR). Thus, ADT limits the action of the AR in prostate and other sensitive tissues (see Chapter 49). In localized, high-risk or advanced prostate cancer (prior to metas­ tasis or after metastatic progression), the combination of ADT and AR antagonists or androgen synthesis inhibitors is the standard of care but not a curative treatment. Disease progression commonly occurs despite this “combined androgen blockade” and signifies the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). In CRPC, the target of com­ bined androgen blockade, AR, is typically “reactivated” through a variety of mechanisms (reviewed in Desai et al., 2021; Einstein et al., 2019; Luo et al., 2018; Nakazawa et al., 2017) including increased AR levels, expres­ sion of constitutively active AR splice variants that lack the ligand binding domain, or acquisition of somatic  AR  gene gain-of-function mutations that render AR promiscuous for activation by other steroid hormones (including weak adrenal androgens or glucocorticoids) and, in rare cases, by AR antagonists. Increased expression or activity of AR coactivators and pioneer transcription factors (e.g., FOXA1) or decreased AR core­ pressor proteins may also participate in continued AR activity in CRPC. Another mechanism that may drive persistent AR signaling in CRPC is local production of sufficient quantities of androgens by CRPC tumors to activate AR. Therefore, second-generation, highly potent AR antagonists and inhibitors of androgen synthesis are employed concurrently with GnRH agonists or antagonists as frontline or second-line therapies fol­ lowing progression to CRPC (reviewed in Mitsiades and Kaochar, 2021). Combining ADT with a newer generation AR antagonist or an androgen synthesis–directed drug is associated with improvements in symptoms and prolongation of survival. Use of Glucocorticoids in Hematological Malignancies Glucocorticoids act by binding to a specific glucocorticoid receptor (GR) that is a member of the nuclear receptor family of transcription factors. Agonist-liganded GR translocates to the nucleus and induces complex gene expression changes (see Chapter 50) that lead to antiproliferative and apoptotic responses in sensitive cells. Because of their lympholytic effects and their ability to suppress mitosis in lymphocytes, glucocorti­ coids are used as cytotoxic agents in the treatment of acute leukemia in children and malignant lymphoma in children and adults. In acute lym­ phoblastic or undifferentiated leukemia of childhood, glucocorticoids may produce prompt clinical improvement and objective hematologi­ cal remissions in 30% of children. However, the duration of remission is brief. Remissions occur more rapidly with glucocorticoids than with antimetabolites, and there is no evidence of cross-resistance to unrelated agents. Thus, therapy is initiated with  prednisone  and  vincristine  (see Chapter 70), often followed by an anthracycline or  methotrexate  (see Chapter 70), and  l-asparaginase  (see Chapter 72). Glucocorticoids are a valuable component of curative regimens for other lymphoid malig­ nancies, including Hodgkin disease, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Glucocorticoids are extremely helpful in controlling autoimmune hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia associated with CLL. Endocrine Therapy for Other Malignancies Endocrine therapies are occasionally used in other malignancies.  Tamox­ ifen  and  medroxyprogesterone   acetate  have activity in metastatic endome­ trial carcinoma, particularly in low-grade tumors. Use of endocrine therapy in ovarian cancer has also been considered. Drugs That Target GnRH/LHRH GnRH Agonists Synthetic GnRH analogues (e.g.,  triptorelin ,  goserelin ,  leuprolide ,  histrelin, and  nafarelin ) have amino acid substitutions at key residues of the 1437 PHARMACOTHERAPY OF NEOPLASTIC DISEASE SECTION VIII TABLE 73–1   ■   ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (ER)–TARGETED THERAPY IN ER+ BREAST CANCER DRUG (DAILY STANDARD DOSE) THERAPEUTIC APPROACH IN DISEASE SETTING CHEMOPREVENTION ADJUVANT THERAPY METASTATIC DISEASE PREMENOPAUSAL POSTMENOPAUSAL PREMENOPAUSAL POSTMENOPAUSAL PREMENOPAUSAL POSTMENOPAUSAL Tamoxifen (20 mg PO) Yes (5 years) Yes (5 years) Yes (5–10 years) Yes (before AI for 2–5 years) Yes Yes Raloxifene (60 mg PO) Yes (5 years) Fulvestrant (500 mg IM day 1, day 15, day 29, then once per month) Yes Anastrozole (1 mg PO) Yes (5 years) Yes (5–10 years) (up front or after tamoxifen) Yes Letrozole (2.5 mg PO) Yes (5–10 years) (up front or after tamoxifen) Yes Exemestane (25 mg PO) Yes (5 years) Yes (5–10 years) (up front or after tamoxifen) Yes GnRH agonist in addition to one of above given monthly Yes (with tamoxifen or AI) Yes (with tamoxifen, AI, or fulvestrant) naturally occurring decapeptide GnRH that increases analogue binding affinity to the GnRH receptor and reduces susceptibility to enzymatic degradation. These GnRH agonists are 100-fold more potent than the native decapeptide. Administration of long-acting GnRH agonists down­ regulates GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland in both women and men. In women, the downregulation of GnRH receptors suppresses the release of the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and LH from the pituitary and prevents follicular maturation in the ovary. Serum estrogen levels are reduced to those seen in postmenopausal women or in women after oophorectomy. GnRH agonists are used in the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer or metastatic disease for women who have functioning ovaries; typically, they are used in combination with either tamoxifen  or AIs. In treating prostate cancer, the most common form of ADT involves chemical suppression of pituitary gland function with long-acting GnRH agonists ( leuprolide ,  goserelin ,  buserelin ). ADT is given to patients with localized intermediate- to high-risk prostate cancer in conjunction with radiation therapy or in some cases following surgical removal of the pros­ tate gland. GnRH agonists cause an initial release of both LH and FSH and a subsequent increase in testosterone production termed “testoster­ one flare” from testicular Leydig cells.

[26] women. Several urine-derived preparations are available; all of them are administered intramuscularly due to local reactions. Recombinant hCG ( choriogonadotropin alfa ) is the predominant preparation used clinically. 935 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY Recombinant Human LH Menotropins contain considerable LH activity, thereby providing any LH activity that is needed to promote follicle maturation. Traditionally, LH was not used for ovulation induction because hCG produced identical effects via the LH receptor and had a longer  t 1/2 . Human LH produced using recombinant DNA technology and designated  lutropin alfa  has been discontinued from the U.S. market but is available elsewhere. Diagnostic Uses Pregnancy Testing During pregnancy, the placenta produces significant amounts of hCG, which can be detected in maternal urine. Over-the-counter pregnancy kits containing antibodies specific for the unique β subunit of hCG qual­ itatively assay for the presence of hCG and can detect pregnancy within a few days after a woman’s first missed menstrual period. Quantitative measurements of plasma hCG concentration by radioimmunoassay can indicate whether pregnancy is proceeding normally and can help to detect the presence of an ectopic pregnancy, hydatidiform mole, or chori­ ocarcinoma. Such assays also are used to follow the therapeutic response of malignancies that secrete hCG, such as germ cell tumors. Timing of Ovulation Ovulation occurs about 36 h after the onset of the LH surge. Therefore, urinary concentrations of LH, as measured with an over-the-counter ELISA kit, can be used to predict the time of ovulation. Urine LH levels are measured every 12 to 24 h, beginning on day 10 to 12 of the menstrual cycle (assuming a 28-day cycle), to detect the rise in LH and estimate the time of ovulation. This estimate facilitates the timing of sexual inter­ course to optimize the chance of achieving pregnancy. Localization of Endocrine Disease Measurements of plasma LH and FSH levels with β-subunit–specific ELISA kits are useful in the diagnosis of several reproductive disorders. Low or undetectable levels of LH and FSH are indicative of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism and suggest hypothalamic or pituitary disease, whereas high levels of gonadotropins suggest primary gonadal diseases. A plasma FSH level of 10 to 12 mIU/mL or greater on day 3 of the menstrual cycle is associated with reduced fertility. Elevated FSH levels also are diagnostic of menopause in women with amenorrhea in the appropriate age range. Human CG can be used to stimulate testosterone production and thus to assess Leydig cell function in males suspected of having primary hypo­ gonadism (e.g., in delayed puberty). A diminished response to multiple injections of hCG indicates Leydig cell failure; a normal response sug­ gests a hypothalamic-pituitary disorder and normal Leydig cells. Therapeutic Uses Male Infertility In men with impaired fertility secondary to gonadotropin deficiency (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), gonadotropins can establish or restore fertility (Farhat et al., 2010). Treatment typically is initiated with hCG (1500–2000 IU intramuscularly or subcutaneously) three times per week until the plasma testosterone levels indicate full induction of ste­ roidogenesis. Thereafter, the dose of hCG is reduced to 2000 IU twice a week or 1000 IU three times a week. If spermatogenesis does not occur with hCG alone, then recombinant FSH (typical dose of 150 IU) is added to fully induce spermatogenesis. The most common side effect of gonadotropin therapy in males is gynecomastia, which occurs in up to a third of patients and presumably reflects increased production of estrogens due to the induction of aroma­ tase. Maturation of the prepubertal testes typically requires treatment for more than 6 months, and optimal spermatogenesis in some patients may require treatment for up to 2 years. Once spermatogenesis has been ini­ tiated, ongoing treatment with hCG alone usually is sufficient to support sperm production. Cryptorchidism Cryptorchidism, the failure of one or both testes to descend into the scro­ tum, affects up to 3% of full-term male infants and becomes less prevalent with advancing postnatal age. Cryptorchid testes have defective spermato­ genesis and are at increased risk for developing germ cell tumors. Hence, the current approach is to reposition the testes as early as possible, typically at 1 year of age but definitely before 2 years of age. The local actions of androgens stimulate descent of the testes; thus, hCG has been used by some to induce testicular descent if the cryptorchidism is not secondary to ana­ tomical blockage. Therapy usually consists of injections of hCG (3000 IU/m 2 body surface area) intramuscularly every other day for six doses. Posterior Pituitary Hormones: Oxytocin and Vasopressin The neurohypophyseal hormones oxytocin and arginine vasopressin are cyclic nonapeptides that differ by only two amino acids (Figure 46–7). The physiology and pharmacology of vasopressin are presented in Chapter 29. Physiology of Oxytocin Oxytocin  is best known for its female roles in parturition and breastfeed­ ing but is also implicated in regulation of the autonomic nervous system. In males, oxytocin seems incidental and modulates sperm motility and testosterone production. It is synthesized as a larger precursor peptide in magnocellular neurons whose cell bodies reside in the paraventricular nucleus and, to a lesser extent, the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothala­ mus. The precursor peptide is rapidly cleaved to active oxytocin and neu­ rophysin I, packaged into secretory granules as an oxytocin-neurophysin complex, and secreted from nerve endings that terminate primarily in the posterior pituitary gland (neurohypophysis). In addition, oxytocinergic neurons project to regions of the hypothalamus, olfactory nucleus, cor­ tex, limbic system, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. Other sites of oxytocin synthesis include the luteal cells of the ovary, the endometrium, the placenta, Leydig cells of the testis, and nonreproductive tissues; how­ ever, the physiologic significance of extraneuronal oxytocin is not known (Jurek and Neumann, 2018). Oxytocin acts via a specific GPCR (OXTR) closely related to the V 1a and V 2  vasopressin receptors. In the human myometrium, oxytocin binds OXTR on uterine myocytes resulting in the coupling of G q/11 , activation of the PLC β -IP 3 -Ca 2+  pathway, and enhanced activation of voltage-sensitive Ca 2+  channels to stimulate uterine muscle contraction (Figure 46–8). Oxytocin also increases uterine prostaglandin production, which further stimulates contraction. In human mammary tissue, oxytocin stimulates contraction of myoepithelial cells through OTXR to eject milk, known as — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[27] zona glomerulosa converts corticosterone to aldo- sterone. The zona glomerulosa  does not  produce glucocorticoids for two reasons: (1) Corticosterone, a glucocorticoid, is converted to aldosterone because this zone contains aldosterone synthase, and (2) the zona glomerulosa lacks 17 α -hydroxylase and there- fore is unable to produce cortisol from progesterone. Aldosterone is not the only steroid with miner- alocorticoid activity;  11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and  corticosterone  also have mineralocorticoid activity. Thus if the mineralocorticoid pathway is blocked  below the level of DOC  (e.g., absence of cell by endocytosis. Inside the cells, cholesterol is esterified and stored in cytoplasmic vesicles until it is needed for synthesis of steroid hormones. The enzymes catalyzing the conversion of choles- terol to active steroid hormones require  cytochrome P-450,  molecular oxygen, and NADPH, which serves as the hydrogen donor for the reducing steps. A flavo- protein enzyme called  adrenodoxin reductase  and an iron-containing protein called  adrenodoxin  are inter- mediates in the transfer of hydrogen from NADPH to the cytochrome P-450 enzymes. For purposes of illustration, all of the biosynthetic pathways in the adrenal cortex are shown in  Figure 9.23 . Remember, however, that not all layers of the cortex contain all of the steps in the pathway: Each layer has that portion of the pathway necessary to produce its primary hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids and androgens or mineralocorticoids). The first step in each pathway is catalyzed by  cho- lesterol desmolase.  In this step, the long side chain of cholesterol is removed (i.e., side-chain cleavage) and cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone. Thus all layers of the adrenal cortex contain cholesterol desmolase. Cholesterol desmolase is the rate-limiting enzyme in the pathway, and it is stimulated by  ACTH (see further discussion concerning regulation of cortisol secretion). Follow the pathways for the synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone, and DHEA and androstenedione: ♦	  Glucocorticoids (cortisol).  The major glucocorticoid produced in humans is  cortisol  (hydrocortisone), which is synthesized in the  zonae fasciculata/ reticularis.  Thus the zona fasciculata contains all of the enzymes required to convert cholesterol to cortisol: cholesterol desmolase, which converts cholesterol to pregnenolone; 17 α -hydroxylase, which hydroxylates pregnenolone to form 17-hydroxypregnenolone; 3 β - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, which converts 17- hydroxypregnenolone to 17-hydroxyprogesterone; and 21 β -hydroxylase and 11 β -hydroxylase, which hydroxylate at C11 and C21 to produce the final product, cortisol. Interestingly, some steps in the cortisol biosynthetic pathway can occur in a differ- ent order; for example, hydroxylation at C17 can occur before or after the action of 3 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Cortisol is not the only steroid in the pathway with glucocorticoid activity;  corticosterone  is also a glucocorticoid. For example, if the 17 α -hydroxylase step is blocked, the zona fasciculata still can produce corticosterone without deleterious effect. Thus cor- tisol is not absolutely necessary to sustain life as long as corticosterone is being synthesized. Blocks at the cholesterol desmolase, 3 β -hydroxysteroid dehy- drogenase, 21 β -hydroxylase, or 11 β -hydroxylase steps 432    •    Physiology bursts during a 24-hour period. The lowest secretory rates occur during the evening hours and just after falling asleep (e.g., midnight), and the highest secre- tory rates occur just before awakening in the morning (e.g., 8  AM ). The major burst of cortisol secretion before awakening accounts for one-half of the total daily cortisol secretion. Other adrenal steroids (e.g., adrenal androgens) are secreted in similar bursting diurnal patterns. ACTH secretion also exhibits the same diurnal pattern; in fact, it is the pattern of ACTH secre- tion that drives the diurnal pattern of steroid hormone secretion. The secretion of glucocorticoids by the zonae fasciculata/reticularis is regulated exclusively by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis  ( Fig. 9.25 ). CRH is secreted by the hypothalamus and acts on the corticotrophs of 11 β -hydroxylase or aldosterone synthase), mineralo- corticoids will continue to be produced. However, if the pathway is blocked  above the level of DOC  (e.g., absence of 21 β -hydroxylase), then no mineralocorti- coids will be produced. Regulation of Secretion of Adrenocortical Steroids As discussed previously, the synthesis and secretion of steroid hormones by the adrenal cortex depend on the stimulation of cholesterol desmolase (the first step) by ACTH.  In the absence of ACTH, biosynthesis of adre- nocortical steroid hormones ceases. Two questions arise, therefore:  What regulates the secretion of ACTH? What special regulatory factors control the functions of the zonae reticularis, fasciculata, and glomerulosa? ♦	  The  zonae fasciculata/reticularis,  which secrete glucocorticoids and androgens, are under the exclu- sive control of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. The hypothalamic hormone is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), and the anterior pituitary hormone is ACTH. ♦	  The  zona glomerulosa,  which secretes mineralocor- ticoids, depends on ACTH for the first step in steroid biosynthesis, but otherwise it is controlled separately via the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Control of the zonae fasciculata and reticularis will be discussed together, and control of the zona glomeru- losa will be discussed separately. Regulation of Glucocorticoid and Adrenal Androgen Secretion An impressive feature of the regulation of cortisol secretion is its  pulsatile  nature and its  diurnal  (daily) pattern ( Fig. 9.24 ). The daily profile of blood cortisol levels is characterized by an average of 10 secretory DIURNAL SECRETION OF CORTISOL Plasma cortisol concentration ( µ g/100 mL) Noon 4 PM 8 PM Midnight 4 AM 8 AM Noon 10 0 20 30 Sleep Fig. 9.24    Diurnal pattern of cortisol secretion.

The decreased level of ACTH then causes decreased cortisol secretion, which is measured in the test. The major use of the dexamethasone sup- pression test is in persons with  hypercortisolism (high levels of cortisol). The test is used to determine whether the hypercortisolism is due to an ACTH- secreting tumor or a cortisol-secreting tumor of the adrenal cortex. If the cause of hypercortisolism is an ACTH-secreting tumor  of the anterior pituitary, a low dose of dexamethasone does not suppress cor- tisol secretion but a high dose of dexamethasone does. (The tumor’s ACTH secretion is less sensitive to negative feedback by glucocorticoids than is normal anterior pituitary tissue.)

[28] estrogen. If a gonadal female is exposed to high levels of androgens in utero (e.g., from excessive pro- duction by the adrenal cortex) when the external genitalia are differentiating, then a male phenotype results. If such exposure occurs after differentiation of the external genitalia, the female phenotype is retained, but perhaps with enlargement of the clitoris ( Box 10.2 ). PUBERTY Gonadotropin Secretion Over the Lifetime In both males and females, gonadal function is driven by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, whose activity varies over the life span, as shown in  Figure 10.2 . Secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), the hypothalamic hormone, begins at gestational week 4, but its levels remain low until puberty. Secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), the anterior pituitary hormones, begins become  the female genital tract if they had not been suppressed by antimüllerian hormone.) The external male genitalia, the penis and scrotum, differentiate at gestational weeks 9–10. Growth and development of the external male genitalia depend on conver- sion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone and the presence of androgen receptors on the target tissues ( Box 10.1 ). ♦	  Female phenotype.  Gonadal females have ovaries that secrete  estrogen,  but they do not secrete anti- müllerian hormone or testosterone. Thus in females no testosterone  is available to stimulate growth and differentiation of the wolffian ducts into the internal male genital tract, and  no antimüllerian hormone  is available to suppress differentiation of the müllerian ducts. Consequently the müllerian ducts develop into the internal female tract (fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper one-third of the vagina). Like the internal genital tract, the development of the external female genitalia (clitoris, labia majora, labia minora, and lower two-thirds of the vagina) does not require any hormones, although growth of these BOX 10.1   Clinical Physiology: Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome DESCRIPTION OF CASE.   A girl who is apparently normal begins to develop breasts at age 11, and at age 13, she is considered to have larger-than-average breasts among her peers. However, by age 16, she has not begun to menstruate and has scant pubic and axillary hair. Upon pelvic examination, a gynecologist notes the presence of testes and a short vagina but no cervix, ovaries, or uterus. Chromosomal evaluation reveals that the girl has an XY genotype. Suspecting a form of androgen insensitivity syndrome (a testicular feminization), the physician orders androgen-binding studies in genital skin fibroblasts. The studies show no binding of testosterone or dihydrotestosterone, sug- gesting that androgen receptors in the tissue are absent or defective. She has mildly elevated levels of plasma testosterone and elevated levels of luteinizing hormone (LH). The young woman’s testes are removed, and she is treated with intermittent estrogen replacement therapy. She is advised, however, that she will never have menstrual cycles or be able to bear children. EXPLANATION OF CASE.   This girl has a female phenotype with female external genitalia (lower vagina, clitoris, and labia). At puberty, she develops breasts. However, she has a male genotype (XY) and male gonads (testes). The basis for her disorder, a form of androgen insensitivity syndrome, is lack of androgen recep- tors in target tissues, which results in resistance to androgens. Her testes, which are normal, secreted both antimüllerian hormone and testosterone in utero. As in normal males, antimüllerian hormone suppressed development of the müllerian ducts in utero; therefore the girl has no fallopian tubes, uterus, or upper vagina. The testes also secreted testosterone in utero, which should have  stimulated growth and differentiation of the wolffian ducts into the male genital tract and devel- opment of the male external genitalia. The male genital tract and external genitalia  did not  develop, however, because the target tissues lack androgen receptors. Thus although the testes secreted normal amounts of testosterone, testosterone could not act on the tissues of the male genital tract. (Lack of androgen receptors also explains the girl’s scant body hair at puberty.) The female phenotype (short vagina, labia, and clitoris) is present because, in the absence of testosterone receptors, the fetus became a phenotypic female by “default.” The girl’s breasts developed at puberty because her testes are producing estradiol from testosterone, stimu- lated by the high-circulating levels of LH. The estradiol then promotes breast development. TREATMENT.   In androgen insensitivity syndrome, because the testes can develop a neoplasm, they are removed. Following removal of the testes (and therefore removal of the testicular source of estradiol), the girl is treated with estrogen therapy to maintain her breasts. She will not be able to bear children, however, because she lacks ovaries and a uterus. 464    •    Physiology levels of FSH and LH reverse, with LH levels becoming higher than FSH levels. In addition, in females, there is a 28-day cycle of gonadotropin secretion called the menstrual cycle. Finally, in senescence, gonadotropin secretion rates increase further, with FSH levels becoming higher than LH levels, as they were in childhood. between gestational weeks 10 and 12. Like GnRH, the levels of FSH and LH remain low until puberty. During childhood, FSH levels are relatively higher than LH levels. At puberty and throughout the reproductive years, the secretory pattern changes: Secretion of GnRH, FSH, and LH increases and becomes pulsatile. The relative BOX 10.2   Clinical Physiology: Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia DESCRIPTION OF CASE.   At birth, a baby is found to have ambiguous external genitalia. There is no penis, and a clitoris is significantly enlarged. Chromosomal evaluation reveals that the baby has an XX genotype. She is found to have ovaries but no testes. Tests confirm that the baby has a form of adrenal hyperplasia in which there is congenital lack of the adrenal cortical enzyme 21 β -hydroxylase. Treatment involves surgical reconstruction of the external genitalia to conform to the female phenotype and the administration of gluco- corticoids and mineralocorticoids. The child will be raised as a female. EXPLANATION OF CASE.   The baby has a congenital absence of 21 β -hydroxylase, the adrenal enzyme that normally converts steroid precursors to mineralocorti- coids and cortisol (see Chapter 9, Fig. 9.23). As a result of this defect, steroid precursors accumulate behind the enzyme block and are directed toward the production of the adrenal androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione.

[30] upstream inhibition of kisspeptin neurons of the hypothalamic infundib­ ular nucleus (arcuate nucleus in rodents), and this may contribute to the postovulatory decrease in GnRH and LH pulse activity during the luteal phase (estrus in rodents). However, sustained elevated estradiol near the end of the follicular phase (proestrus in rodents) exerts positive feedback effects on a different kisspeptin population in the hypothalamic preop­ tic area. This estradiol-induced activation of preoptic kisspeptin neurons results in high stimulation of GnRH secretion, thereby stimulating a surge in LH release that triggers ovulation. In men, testosterone inhibits gonadotropin production via actions in the hypothalamus and pituitary, in part through direct actions and in part via its conversion by aromatase to estradiol. Other Regulators of Gonadotropin Production.   Gonadotropin pro­ duction is also regulated by  inhibins  and  activin.  Inhibins are members of the bone morphogenetic protein family of secreted signaling proteins. Inhibin A  and  B  are made by granulosa cells in the ovary and Sertoli cells in the testis in response to the gonadotropins and local growth factors. They act directly in the pituitary to inhibit FSH secretion without affect­ ing that of LH. Inhibin A exhibits variation during the menstrual cycle, suggesting that it acts as a dynamic regulator of FSH secretion. Indepen­ dent of GnRH, activin is a positive regulator of FSH synthesis and secre­ tion. Activin is produced in the placenta, pituitary, and gonads, the latter being the main source of circulating activin. The physiological role of circulating activin is unclear due to its being mostly bound by follistatin, a negative regulator of activin. Activin acts primarily as autocrine/para­ crine factors at or near sites of expression, suggesting that the pituitary is the source of bioavailable activin that regulates FSH secretion. In women, activin increases FSH binding and FSH-induced aromatization in the ovarian follicle and enhances LH action in the ovary. In men, activin augments LH action in the testis, increasing androgen production and spermatogenesis. Molecular and Cellular Basis of Gonadotropin Action The actions of LH and hCG on target tissues are mediated by the LH receptor; those of FSH are mediated by the FSH receptor. The FSH and LH receptors couple to G s  to activate the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP path­ way. At higher ligand concentrations, the agonist-occupied gonadotropin receptors also activate PKC and Ca 2+  signaling pathways via G q -mediated effects on PLC β . Most actions of the gonadotropins can be mimicked by cAMP analogues. Clinical Disorders of the Hypothalamic- Pituitary-Gonadal Axis Clinical disorders of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis can man­ ifest either as alterations in levels and effects of sex steroids (hyper- or hypogonadism) or as impaired reproduction. This section focuses on those conditions that specifically affect the hypothalamic-pituitary com­ ponents of the axis and those for which gonadotropins are used diagnos­ tically or therapeutically. Deficient sex steroid production resulting from hypothalamic or pituitary defects is termed  hypogonadotropic hypogonadism  because cir­ culating levels of gonadotropins are either low or undetectable. Hypogo­ nadotropic hypogonadism in some patients results from GnRH receptor mutations. Some of these mutations impair targeting of the GnRH recep­ tor to the plasma membrane of gonadotropes, prompting efforts to develop pharmacological strategies to correct receptor trafficking and restore function (Conn et al., 2007). Many other disorders can impair gonadotropin secretion, including pituitary tumors, genetic disorders such as Kallmann syndrome, infiltrative processes such as sarcoidosis, and functional disorders such as exercise-induced amenorrhea. In contrast, reproductive disorders caused by processes that directly impair gonadal function are termed  hypergonadotropic  because the impaired production of sex steroids leads to a loss of negative- feedback inhibition, thereby increasing the synthesis and secretion of gonadotropins. •  Precocious Puberty.  Puberty normally is a sequential process requir­ ing several years over which the GnRH neurons escape CNS inhibition and initiate pulsatile secretion of GnRH. This stimulates the secretion of gonadotropins and gonadal steroids, thus directing the develop­ ment of secondary sexual characteristics. Normally, the initial signs of 933 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY puberty (breast development in girls and testes enlargement in boys) do not occur before age 8 in girls or age 9 in boys. The initiation of sexual maturation before this time is termed “precocious.” GnRH-dependent excessive secretion of gonadotropins is rare and causes precocious puberty in children. This condition may be due to GnRH-producing hamartomas or other CNS abnormalities, but often no specific abnor­ mality is found. This central precocious puberty must be differentiated from that due to hormone-producing tumors of the gonads, in which case, gonadotropin levels will be low. GnRH-independent precocious puberty results from peripheral production of sex steroids in a man­ ner not driven by pituitary gonadotropins. Etiologies include adrenal or gonadal tumors, activating mutations of the LH receptor in boys, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Synthetic GnRH analogues play important roles in the diagnosis and treatment of GnRH-dependent precocious puberty (see further discussion). In contrast, drugs that interfere with the production of sex steroids, including  ketoconazole and aromatase inhibitors, are used in patients with GnRH-independent precocious puberty (Shulman et al., 2008), with varying success. •  Sexual Infantilism.  The converse of precocious puberty is a failure to initiate the processes of pubertal development at the normal time. This can reflect defects in the GnRH neurons or gonadotropes (secondary hypogonadism) or primary dysfunction in the gonads. In either case, induction of sexual maturation using sex steroids (estrogen followed by estrogen/progesterone in females, testosterone in males) is standard therapy. This suffices to direct sex differentiation in the normal man­ ner. If fertility is the goal, then therapy with either GnRH or gonado­ tropins is needed to stimulate appropriate germ cell maturation. •  Infertility.  Infertility, or a failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, is seen in up to 10% to 15% of couples and is increasing in frequency as women choose to delay childbearing. When the infertility is due to impaired synthesis or secretion of gonado­ tropins (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), various pharmacological approaches are employed. In contrast, when infertility results from intrinsic processes affecting the gonads, pharmacotherapy generally is less effective. Therapeutic approaches to male infertility are described further in this chapter; strategies for female infertility are described in Chapter 48.

[31] monthly cycle, the decline in FSH and LH secretion comes to an abrupt halt. The high level of estrogens at this time (or the beginning of progesterone se­ cretion by the follicles) is believed to cause a posi­ tive feedback stimulatory effect on the anterior pi­ tuitary, as explained earlier, which leads to a large surge in the secretion of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH. Whatever the cause of this preovulatory LH and FSH surge, the great excess of LH leads to both ovulation and subsequent development of and se­ cretion by the corpus luteum. Thus, the hormonal system begins its new round of secretions until the next instance of ovulation. Anovulatory Cycles—Sexual Cycles at Puberty If the preovulatory surge of LH is not of sufficient magni­ tude, ovulation will not occur, and the cycle is said to be “anovulatory.” The phases of the sexual cycle continue, but they are altered in the following ways: 1.	 Lack of ovulation causes failure of development of the corpus luteum, so there is almost no secretion of progesterone during the latter portion of the cy­ cle. 2.	 The cycle is shortened by several days, but the rhythm continues. Therefore, it is likely that progesterone is not required for maintenance of the cycle, although it can alter the cycle’s rhythm. The first few cycles after the onset of puberty are usually anovulatory, as are the cycles occurring several months to years before menopause, presumably because the LH surge is not potent enough at these times to cause ovulation. PUBERTY AND MENARCHE Puberty  means the onset of adult sexual life, and  men­ arche  means the beginning of the cycle of menstruation. The period of puberty is caused by a gradual increase in gonadotropic hormone secretion by the pituitary, begin­ ning in about the eighth year of life, as shown in  Figure 82-­12 , and usually culminating in the onset of puberty and menstruation between ages 10 and 14 years in girls (average, 12 years). In the female, as in the male, the infantile pituitary gland and ovaries are capable of full function if they are appropri­ ately stimulated. However, as is also true in the male, and for reasons that are not understood, the hypothalamus does not secrete significant quantities of GnRH during childhood. Experiments have shown that the hypothalamus is capable of secreting this hormone, but the appropriate signal from some other area of the brain to cause secretion is lacking. Therefore, it is now believed that the onset of puberty is ini­ tiated by some maturation process that occurs elsewhere in the brain, perhaps somewhere in the limbic system. Figure 82-­13  shows (1) the increasing levels of estrogen secretion at puberty, (2) the cyclical variation during the monthly sexual cycle, (3) the further increase in estrogen secretion during the first few years of reproductive life, (4) the progressive decrease in estrogen secretion toward the end of reproductive life, and, finally, (5) almost no estrogen or progesterone secretion beyond menopause.

Chapter 82   Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones 1041 U N I T  X I V months to a few years, the cycle ceases altogether, as shown in  Figure 82-­13 . The period during which the cycle ceases and the female sex hormones diminish to almost none is called  menopause. The cause of menopause is “burning out” of the ovaries. Throughout a woman’s reproductive life, about 400 of the primordial follicles grow into mature follicles and ovulate, and hundreds of thousands of ova degenerate. At about age 45 years, only a few primordial follicles remain to be stimulated by FSH and LH and, as shown in  Figure 82-­ 13 , the production of estrogens by the ovaries decreases as the number of primordial follicles approaches zero. When estrogen production falls below a critical value, the estrogens can no longer inhibit the production of FSH and LH. Instead, as shown in  Figure 82-­12 , the gonado­ tropins FSH and LH (mainly FSH) are produced after menopause in large and continuous quantities, but as the remaining primordial follicles become atretic, production of estrogens by the ovaries falls virtually to zero. At the time of menopause, a woman must readjust her life from one that has been physiologically stimulated by estrogen and progesterone production to one devoid of these hormones. The loss of estrogens often causes marked physiological changes in the function of the body, including (1) “hot flushes” characterized by extreme flushing of the skin, (2) psychic sensations of dyspnea, (3) irritability, (4) fatigue, (5) anxiety, and (6) decreased strength and calcification of bones throughout the body. These symptoms are of sufficient magnitude in about 15% of women to warrant treatment. Daily administration of estrogen in small quantities usually reverses the symp­ toms, and by gradually decreasing the dose, postmeno­ pausal women may avoid severe symptoms. Large clinical trials have provided evidence that admin­ istration of estrogen after menopause, although ameliorat­ ing many of the symptoms of menopause, may increase the risk for cardiovascular disease. As a result, hormone replacement therapy with estrogen is no longer routinely prescribed for postmenopausal women. Some studies, however, suggest that estrogen therapy may actually reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease if it is begun early in the postmenopausal years. Therefore, it is currently recom­ mended that postmenopausal women who are considering hormone replacement therapy should discuss with their physicians whether the benefits outweigh the risks.

[32] until approximately 6 months after birth, at which point all oogonia have become oocytes. The oocytes remain in a state of suspended prophase; the first meiotic division will not be completed until ovulation occurs many years later. Simultaneously, there is attri- tion of oocytes. At birth, only 2 million oocytes remain; by puberty, only 400,000 oocytes remain; by menopause (which marks the end of the reproductive period), few, if any, oocytes remain. Whereas males continuously produce spermatogonia and spermatocytes, females do not produce new oogonia and function from a declining pool of oocytes.

Recall also that the testes, having 17 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, produce testosterone as their major hormonal product. In the ovaries,  all  steps in the biosynthetic pathway are present including   aromatase,  which converts testosterone to 17 β -estradiol, the major ovarian estrogen. Progesterone and 17 β -estradiol are synthesized as follows:  Theca cells  synthesize and secrete proges- terone. Theca cells also synthesize androstenedione; this androstenedione diffuses from the theca cells regresses during the next 14 days (the second half of the menstrual cycle) and is replaced by a scar called the  corpus albicans. Synthesis and Secretion of Estrogen and Progesterone The ovarian steroid hormones, progesterone and 17 β - estradiol, are synthesized by the ovarian follicles through the combined functions of the  granulosa cells and the  theca cells  ( Fig. 10.8 ). Virtually all steps in the biosynthetic pathway are the same as those discussed previously for the adrenal cortex and the testes.

Both functions are controlled by the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. As in the testes, the hypothalamic hormone is GnRH and the anterior pituitary hormones are FSH and LH. GnRH Like testicular function in the male, ovarian func- tion in the female is driven by  pulsatile  activity of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. GnRH is delivered directly to the anterior lobe of the pituitary in high concentration, where it stimulates pulsatile secretion of FSH and LH. FSH and LH then act on the ovaries to stimulate follicular development and ovulation and to stimulate the synthesis of the female sex steroid hormones. FSH and LH To understand the hypothalamic-pituitary control of the ovaries, it is necessary to appreciate its cyclic behavior. Every 28 days a sequence of follicular development, ovulation, and formation and degeneration of a corpus luteum is repeated in the  menstrual cycle.  The first 14 days of the menstrual cycle involve follicular develop- ment and are called the  follicular phase.  The last 14 days of the menstrual cycle are dominated by the corpus luteum and are called the  luteal phase.  At the midpoint of the cycle, between the follicular and luteal phases,  ovulation  occurs. The actions of FSH and LH on follicular development and on ovulation are explained as follows: ♦	  FSH.  The granulosa cells are the only ovarian cells with FSH receptors. Initial actions of FSH stimulate the growth of granulosa cells in primary follicles and stimulate estradiol synthesis. The locally produced estradiol then supports the trophic effect of FSH on follicular cells. Thus the two effects of FSH on the granulosa cells are mutually reinforcing: more cells, more estradiol, more cells. ♦	  LH.  Ovulation is initiated by LH. Just prior to ovula- tion, the concentration of LH in blood rises sharply and induces rupture of the dominant follicle, releas- ing the oocyte. LH also stimulates formation of the corpus luteum, a process called luteinization, and maintains steroid hormone production by the corpus luteum during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. Negative and Positive Feedback In females, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is controlled by  both  negative and positive feedback,  depending on the phase of the menstrual cycle ( Fig. 10.9 ). to the nearby granulosa cells, which contain 17 β - hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and aromatase. In the granulosa cells,  androstenedione is converted to testosterone and testosterone is then converted to 17 β - estradiol. FSH and LH each have roles in the bio- synthetic process.  LH  stimulates cholesterol desmolase in the theca cells, the first step in the biosynthetic pathway (parallel to its role in the testes).  FSH  stimu- lates aromatase in the granulosa cells, the last step in the synthesis of 17 β -estradiol.

One action of estradiol is  negative feedback on GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus and FSH and LH secretion by the anterior pituitary. Thus the follicular phase is dominated by negative feedback effects of estradiol on the hypothalamic- pituitary axis. ♦	  At  midcycle,  the feedback pattern reverses.

[33] lators of steroid production: AngII and K +  for the zona glomerulosa and ACTH for the zona fasciculata. Although ACTH acutely increases DHEA biosynthesis, the physiological regulators of DHEA production by the zona reticularis are not completely known. Adrenal steroid hormones are produced from the same precursor, cho­ lesterol, by a set of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP11A1, CYP11B1 and CYP11B2, and CYP17A1 and CYP21A2) and the steroid dehydrogenase 3β-HSD. These enzymes are differentially expressed in the three zones of the adrenal cortex giving rise to zone-specific hormone production. Some of the enzymes encoded by these genes can catalyze more than one reaction. Cells in the zona glomerulosa have receptors for both ACTH and angiotensin II (AngII) and express aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2), the enzyme that catalyzes the terminal reactions in mineralocorticoid bio­ synthesis. Although ACTH acutely stimulates mineralocorticoid produc­ tion, this zone is regulated primarily by AngII and extracellular K +  (see Chapter 30) and remains functional in the absence of pituitary func­ tion. With persistently elevated ACTH, mineralocorticoid levels initially increase but then return to normal (a phenomenon termed ACTH escape). Cells of the zona fasciculata have receptors for ACTH and express 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) and 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1). These enzymes catalyze the production of glucocorticoids under the control of ACTH. In the zona reticularis, 17α-hydroxylase carries out an additional C17-20 lyase reaction that converts C21 corticosteroids into the C19 androgen precursors. In the absence of ACTH stimulation (as may occur in hypopituitarism), the zona fasciculata and reticularis undergo atrophy, and production of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens is severely impaired. Conversely, persistently elevated levels of ACTH induce hypertrophy and hyperplasia of these inner zones, with concomitant overproduction of glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens. Adrenal hyperplasia is most marked in congenital disorders of steroidogenesis, in which ACTH levels are continually ele­ vated as a secondary response to impaired cortisol biosynthesis. Mechanism of Action ACTH stimulates the synthesis and release of the adrenocortical hor­ mones by increasing  de novo  biosynthesis (steroid hormones are hydro­ phobic and thus cannot be stored). ACTH binding to MC2R activates the G s –adenylyl cyclase–cyclic AMP–PKA pathway. Cyclic AMP is the second messenger for most effects of ACTH on steroidogenesis. Temporally, the response of adrenocortical cells to ACTH has two phases. The acute phase, which occurs within seconds to minutes, largely reflects an increased supply of cholesterol substrate to the steroidogenic enzymes. The chronic phase, which occurs over hours to days, results from increased transcription of the steroidogenic enzymes. A number of transcriptional regulators participate in the induction of the steroidogenic enzymes by ACTH. Among these is the nuclear recep­ tor NRSA1 (steroidogenic factor 1), a transcription factor required for the development of the adrenal cortex and for the expression of most of the steroidogenic enzymes (Schimmer and White, 2010). Pathways of adre­ nal steroid biosynthesis and the structures of the major steroid intermedi­ ates and products of the human adrenal cortex are shown in Figure 50–3. The rate-limiting step in steroid hormone production is the translocation of cholesterol across mitochondrial membranes by the steroid acute reg­ ulatory (StAR) protein. Cholesterol is then converted to pregnenolone by the side-chain cleavage enzyme CYP11A1, which represents the first enzymatic step in steroid hormone biosynthesis (Miller and Auchus, 2011). Most of the enzymes required for steroid hormone biosynthesis, including CYP11A1, are members of the cytochrome P450 superfamily (see Chapter 5). To ensure an adequate supply of substrate, the adrenal cortex uses multiple sources of cholesterol, including circulating choles­ terol and cholesterol esters taken up via the low-density lipoprotein and high-density lipoprotein receptor pathways; endogenous cholesterol lib­ erated from cholesterol ester stores via activation of cholesterol esterase; and endogenous cholesterol from  de novo  biosynthesis. Regulation of ACTH Secretion Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) Axis The rate of glucocorticoid secretion is determined by fluctuations in the release of ACTH by the pituitary corticotrophs. These corticotrophs are regulated by CRH and AVP, peptide hormones made by specialized neu­ rons of the hypothalamus and released into the network of portal veins bathing the anterior pituitary (Sheng et al., 2021). This HPA axis forms an integrated system that maintains appropriate levels of glucocorticoids (Figure 50–4). The three characteristic modes of physiological regulation of the HPA axis are: • Diurnal rhythm in basal steroidogenesis • Negative-feedback regulation by adrenal corticosteroids • Marked increases in steroidogenesis in response to stress https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 1006 CHAPTER 50  ADRENOCORTICOTROPIC HORMONE, ADRENAL STEROIDS, AND THE ADRENAL CORTEX Glomerulosa Aldosterone Corticosterone Progesterone Pregnenolone Cholesterol Deoxycorticosterone Cortisol Reticularis Fasciculata Androstenedione DHEAS DHEA Aldosterone synthase Aldosterone synthase 21 hydroxylase (CYP21A2) 11 β -hydroxylase 3 β -HSD 17 α  hydroxylase (CYP17A1) 17 a   pregnenolone 17 a   hydroxyprogesterone 17–20 lyase Sulfotransferase CYP11A1 HO 11-deoxycortisol HO O O O O S O H H H H O OH O H O HO H 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 10 19 11 15 12  18 21 22 24 26 27 25 13 14 16 17 20 23 9 8 O HO HO HO H H H H H O H H H H O OH O H H H HO O OH OH O H H H O OH OH O H H H O O OH O H H H OH O H H H H H O H H H HO O OH O H O H H H Figure 50–3 Pathways of corticosteroid synthesis.  The steroidogenic pathways used in the biosynthesis of the corticosteroids are shown, along with the structures of the intermediates and products.

[34] of the intermediates and products. The reactions in each of the adrenal zones are grouped by dashed lines. The numbering is indicated in the cholesterol structure. Pathological elevation of steroidogenesis is seen in Cushing disease, in the setting of ectopic secretion of CRH or ACTH (often part of a parane­ oplastic syndrome), and in rare conditions as a result of defects in corti­ costeroid receptor–mediated feedback mechanisms. The diurnal rhythm is determined by circadian clocks in the hypo­ thalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus and in the adrenal gland itself and is entrained by higher neuronal centers in response to sleep-wake cycles (Oster et al., 2017). Levels of ACTH peak in the early morning hours, causing the circulating glucocorticoid levels to peak at about 8 AM (Leliavski et al., 2015). Negative-feedback regulation occurs at multiple levels of the HPA axis and is the major mechanism that maintains circu­ lating glucocorticoid levels in the appropriate range. Stress can override the normal negative-feedback control mechanisms, leading to marked increases in plasma concentrations of glucocorticoids. Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone Following release into the hypophyseal plexus, CRH is transported via this portal system to the anterior pituitary, where it binds to specific mem­ brane receptors on corticotrophs. Upon CRH binding, the CRH receptor activates the G s –adenylyl cyclase–cyclic AMP pathway within cortico­ trophs, ultimately stimulating both ACTH biosynthesis and secretion. Arginine Vasopressin Arginine vasopressin acts as a weak secretagogue for corticotrophs on its own but significantly potentiates the effects of CRH. AVP is produced 1007 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and secreted into the pituitary portal veins from the median eminence. AVP binds to V1b receptors and activates the G q -PLC-IP 3 -Ca 2+  pathway to enhance the release of ACTH. In contrast to CRH, AVP by itself does not increase  de novo  ACTH synthesis. Negative Feedback of Glucocorticoids Glucocorticoid feedback of the HPA axis occurs at both the hypothala­ mus and the pituitary, and the effects are both rapid (seconds to minutes) and delayed (requiring hours and involving changes in gene transcrip­ tion) (Keller-Wood, 2015). Glucocorticoids inhibit hypothalamic CRH secretion via direct effects on hypothalamic CRH neurons by decreasing CRH mRNA levels and CRH release. Indirect effects of cortisol on hypo­ thalamic CRH secretion are mediated by both the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) acting on separate CRH neu­ rons in the hippocampus. In the pituitary, glucocorticoids inhibit ACTH secretion through GR by inhibiting corticotroph responsiveness to CRH (rapid response) as well as suppressing POMC expression (delayed response). The involvement of MR in cortisol feedback mechanisms in the CNS is based on the ability of MR to bind and respond to cortisol in cells lacking 11β-HSD2. Because of the higher intrinsic affinity of MR (relative to GR) for cortisol, the major CNS receptor species occupied during periods of low cortisol levels is MR. At higher blood cortisol levels, MR becomes sat­ urated, and GR occupancy increases. Both MR and GR control the basal activity of the HPA axis, whereas feedback inhibition by glucocorticoids predominately occurs via GR. The Stress Response Stress overcomes negative feedback regulation of the HPA axis, leading to a marked rise in corticosteroid levels. Examples of stress signals include trauma, hemorrhage, severe infection, major surgery, hypoglycemia, cold, pain, and fear. Different brain regions are involved in the process­ ing of these stimuli. Although the precise mechanisms that underlie this stress response, and the essential functions of corticosteroids during this process, are not fully defined, increased corticosteroid secretion is vital to maintain homeostasis in these settings. As discussed further in the chapter, complex interactions between the HPA axis and the immune sys­ tem may be a fundamental physiological component of this stress response. Therapeutic Uses and Diagnostic Applications of ACTH and CRH Except for the treatment of infantile spasms, most proven therapeutic effects of ACTH can be achieved with appropriate doses of corticos­ teroids. Moreover, therapy with ACTH is less predictable and less con­ venient than therapy with corticosteroids. ACTH acutely stimulates mineralocorticoid and adrenal androgen secretion and may therefore cause acute retention of salt and water, as well as virilization. ACTH and CRH, however, have important diagnostic applications. Infantile Spasms The mainstay treatment for this rare epileptic disorder of infancy and early childhood is hormonal therapy with ACTH. The mechanism of action is not known but may involve effects independent of adrenal corticosteroid release since ACTH can control spasms in patients with adrenal sup­ pression. Antiepileptic effects involving suppression of CRH in the CNS have been proposed. The formulation used most commonly in the U.S. is measured in units as an injectable gel delivered intramuscularly or subcu­ taneously. In other countries, a long-acting depot formulation of synthetic ACTH is available ( tetracosactide depot ). Diagnostic Use Cosyntropin , a synthetic peptide that corresponds to residues 1–24 of human ACTH, is used in testing the integrity of the HPA axis. At the supraphysiological dose of 0.25 mg,  cosyntropin  maximally stimulates adrenocortical steroidogenesis. An increase in the circulating cortisol level to a level greater than 18 to 20 μg/dL using many of the standard assays indicates a normal response. Newer cortisol assay platforms have higher specificity for cortisol and have corresponding lower normal cut­ offs.  Cosyntropin  may also be used diagnostically during adrenal venous sampling, a procedure used to distinguish between unilateral and bilat­ eral aldosterone secretion in primary aldosteronism. Ovine CRH ( corticorelin ) and human CRH (not available in the U.S.) are used rarely for diagnostic testing of the HPA axis. When evaluating patients with documented ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism, CRH stimulation testing is sometimes used to differentiate pituitary from ectopic sources of ACTH, either alone or more commonly during infe­ rior petrosal sinus sampling. In both cases, pituitary ACTH production is increased by CRH, whereas ectopic ACTH production is not. CRH stimulation testing, after  dexamethasone  suppression, is also occasion­ ally used to assist differentiation of pseudo-Cushing states (as occurs with alcoholism and some neuropsychiatric disorders) from true Cush­ ing syndrome. Assays for ACTH Immunoassays that use two separate antibodies directed at distinct epitopes on the ACTH molecule are now widely available. These assays — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[35] tion of tyrosine kinase in the associated protein (e.g., JAK). The associated tyrosine kinase phosphorylates tyrosine moieties on itself, the hormone receptor, and other proteins. Downstream targets of JAK include members of the  STAT  (signal transducers and activators of transcription) family, which cause transcription of mRNAs and ultimately new proteins involved in the hormone’s physiologic actions. Steroid and Thyroid Hormone Mechanism Steroid hormones and thyroid hormones have the same mechanism of action. In contrast to the adenylyl cyclase and phospholipase C mechanisms utilized by peptide hormones and involving cell membrane receptors and generation of intracellular second messengers, the steroid hormone mechanism involves binding to cyto- solic (or nuclear) receptors ( Fig. 9.7 ) that initiate DNA transcription and synthesis of new proteins. In further contrast to peptide hormones, which act quickly on their target cells (within minutes), steroid hormones act slowly  (taking hours). The steps in the steroid hormone mechanism  (shown in   Fig. 9.8 )  are described as follows: NH 2 COOH DNA-binding domain A/B C D E F Hormone-binding dimerization Zn Zn Fig. 9.7    Structure of cytosolic (or nuclear) steroid hormone receptor.

The pituitary gland, which also is called the hypophysis, consists of a posterior lobe and an anterior lobe. The  posterior lobe  (or posterior pituitary) is also called the neurohypophysis. The  anterior lobe  (or anterior pituitary) is also called the adenohypophysis. The hypothalamus is connected to the pituitary gland by a thin stalk called the  infundibulum.  Functionally, the hypothalamus controls the pituitary gland by both neural and hormonal mechanisms ( Fig. 9.9 ). HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY RELATIONSHIPS The hypothalamus and pituitary gland function in a coordinated fashion to orchestrate many of the endo- crine systems. The hypothalamic-pituitary unit regulates the functions of the thyroid, adrenal, and reproductive glands and also controls growth, milk production and ejection, and osmoregulation.

The cell bodies of ADH- and oxytocin-secreting neurons are located in supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei within the hypothalamus. Although both hor- mones are synthesized in both nuclei,  ADH  is primarily associated with  supraoptic  nuclei and  oxytocin  is primarily associated with  paraventricular  nuclei. Once synthesized in the cell bodies, the hormones (i.e., neuropeptides) are transported down the axons in neurosecretory vesicles and stored in bulbous nerve terminals in the posterior pituitary. When the cell body Relationship of the Hypothalamus to the Posterior Pituitary The posterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from neural tissue. It secretes two peptide hormones, antidi- uretic hormone (ADH) and oxytocin, which act on their respective target tissues—the kidney and arterioles (ADH) and the breast and uterus (oxytocin). The connections between the hypothalamus and the posterior lobe of the pituitary are neural. In fact, the posterior pituitary is a collection of nerve axons whose cell bodies are located in the hypothalamus.

Hypothalamic-releasing hormones and release-inhibiting hormones are synthesized in the cell bodies of hypothalamic neurons and travel down the axons of these neurons to the median eminence of the hypothalamus. Upon stimulation of these neurons, the hormones are secreted into the surrounding hypothalamic tissue and enter the nearby capillary plexus. The blood from these capillaries (now venous blood) drains into the hypophysial portal vessels and is delivered directly to the anterior lobe of the pituitary. There, the hypothalamic hormones act on the cells of the anterior lobe, where they stimulate or inhibit the release of the anterior pituitary hormones. The anterior pituitary hormones then enter the systemic circulation, which delivers them to their target tissues. The hypothalamic-anterior pituitary relationship can be illustrated by considering the TRH–TSH–thyroid hormone system.  TRH  is synthesized in hypothalamic neurons and secreted in the median eminence of the hypothalamus, where it enters capillaries and then hypophysial portal vessels. It is delivered in this portal blood to the anterior lobe of the pituitary, where it stimulates TSH secretion.  TSH  enters the systemic circulation and is delivered to its target tissue, the thyroid gland, where it stimulates secretion of  thyroid hormones. ANTERIOR LOBE HORMONES Six major hormones are secreted by the anterior lobe of the pituitary: TSH, FSH, LH, ACTH, growth hormone, and prolactin. Each hormone is secreted by a different cell type (except FSH and LH, which are secreted by the same cell type). The cell types are denoted by the suffix “troph,” meaning nutritive. Thus TSH is secreted by  thyrotrophs  (5%), FSH and LH by  gonadotrophs (15%), ACTH by  corticotrophs  (15%), growth hormone by  somatotrophs  (20%), and prolactin by  lactotrophs (15%). (The percentages give the representation of each cell type in the anterior pituitary gland.) Each of the anterior pituitary hormones is a peptide or polypeptide.

[36] active form (Fotherby, 1996). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Antiestrogens By altering the conformation of the two different ERs and thereby changing interactions with coactivators and corepressors in cell-specific and promoter-specific contexts, ligands may have a broad spectrum of activities from purely antiestrogenic in all tissues, to partially estrogenic in some tissues with antiestrogenic or no activities in others, to purely estrogenic activities in all tissues. The elucidation of these concepts has been a major breakthrough in estrogen pharmacology and should permit the rational design of drugs with selective patterns of estrogenic activity (Smith and O’Malley, 2004). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators: Tamoxifen, Raloxifene, and Toremifene Selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, are compounds with tissue-selective actions. The pharmacological goal of these drugs is to produce beneficial estrogenic actions in certain tissues (e.g., bone, brain, and liver) during post-MHT but antagonist activity in tissues such as breast and endometrium, where estrogenic actions (e.g., carcinogenesis) might be deleterious. Currently approved drugs in the U.S. in this class are  tamoxifen citrate ,  raloxifene hydrochloride , and  toremifene , which is chemically related and has similar actions to  tamoxifen .  Tamoxifen  and toremifene  are used for the treatment of breast cancer, and  raloxifene  is used primarily for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis and to reduce the risk of invasive breast cancer in high-risk postmenopausal women. They are considered in detail in Chapter 73. Antiestrogens: Clomiphene and Fulvestrant The antiestrogen compounds are distinguished from the SERMs in that they are pure antagonists in all tissues studied.  Clomiphene  is approved for the treatment of infertility in anovulatory women, and  fulvestrant  is used for the treatment of breast cancer in women with disease progres­ sion after  tamoxifen . Chemistry The structures of the  trans -isomer of  tamoxifen , and of  raloxifene ,  trans - clomiphene (enclomiphene), and  fulvestrant  are as follows: Tamoxifen  is a triphenylethylene with the same stilbene nucleus as diethylstilbestrol ; compounds of this class display a variety of estrogenic and antiestrogenic activities. In general, the  trans  conformations have antiestrogenic activity, whereas the  cis  conformations display estrogenic activity. However, the pharmacological activity of the  trans  compound depends on the species, target tissue, and gene. Hepatic metabolism produces primarily  N -desmethyltamoxifen, which has affinity for ER comparable to that of  tamoxifen , and lesser amounts of the highly active 4-hydroxy metabolite, which has a 25- to 50-times higher affinity for both https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 968 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT ERα and ERβ than does  tamoxifen  (Kuiper et al., 1997).  Tamoxifen  is mar­ keted as the pure  trans- isomer.  Toremifene  is a triphenylethylene with a chlorine substitution at the R2 position. Raloxifene  is a polyhydroxylated nonsteroidal compound with a ben­ zothiophene core.  Raloxifene  binds with high affinity for both ERα and ERβ (Kuiper et al., 1997). Clomiphene citrate  is a triphenylethylene; its two isomers, zuclomi­ phene ( cis  clomiphene) and enclomiphene ( trans  clomiphene), are a weak estrogen agonist and a potent antagonist, respectively.  Clomiphene  binds to both ERα and ERβ, but the individual isomers have not been examined (Kuiper et al., 1997). Fulvestrant  is a 7α-alkylamide derivative of estradiol that interacts with both ERα and ERβ (Van Den Bemd et al., 1999). Pharmacological Effects All of these agents bind to the ligand-binding pocket of both ERα and ERβ and competitively block estradiol binding. However, the conforma­ tion of the ligand-bound ERs is different with different ligands (Smith and O’Malley, 2004), and this has two important mechanistic conse­ quences. The distinct ER-ligand conformations recruit different coactiva­ tors and corepressors onto the promoter of a target gene by differential protein-protein interactions at the receptor surface. The tissue-specific actions of SERMs thus can be explained in part by the distinct conforma­ tion of the ER when occupied by different ligands, in combination with dif­ ferent coactivator and corepressor levels in different cell types that together affect the nature of ER complexes formed in a tissue-selective fashion. Tamoxifen.   Tamoxifen  exhibits antiestrogenic, estrogenic, or mixed activity depending on the species and target gene measured. In clinical tests or laboratory studies with human cells, the drug’s activity depends on the tissue and end point measured. For example,  tamoxifen  inhibits the proliferation of cultured human breast cancer cells and reduces tumor size and number in women (Jaiyesimi et al., 1995), and yet it stimulates pro­ liferation of endometrial cells and causes endometrial thickening (Lahti et al., 1993). The drug has an antiresorptive effect on bone, and in humans, it decreases total cholesterol, LDL, and lipoprotein A but does not increase HDL and triglycerides (Love et al., 1994).  Tamoxifen  treatment causes a 2- to 3-fold increase in the relative risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmo­ nary embolism and a roughly 2-fold increase in endometrial carcinoma (Smith, 2003).  Tamoxifen  produces hot flashes and other adverse effects, including cataracts and nausea. Due to its agonist activity in bone, it does not increase the incidence of fractures when used in this setting. The conformation of ERs, especially in the AF-2 domain, determines whether a coactivator or a corepressor will be recruited to the ER-DNA complex (Smith and O’Malley, 2004).  Tamoxifen  induces a conformation that permits the recruitment of the corepressor to both ERα and ERβ, in contrast to 17α-estradiol, which induces a conformation that recruits coactivators to the receptor. The agonist activity of  tamoxifen  seen in tissues such as the endometrium is mediated by the ligand-independent AF-1 transactivation domain of ERα; because ERβ does not contain a functional AF-1 domain,  tamoxifen  does not activate ERβ (McInerney et al., 1998). Raloxifene.   Raloxifene  is an estrogen agonist in bone, where it exerts an antiresorptive effect. The drug also acts as an estrogen agonist in reduc­ ing total cholesterol and LDL, but it does not increase HDL or normalize PAI-1 in postmenopausal women (Walsh et al., 1998). Studies indicated that  raloxifene  has an antiproliferative effect on ER-positive breast tumors and significantly reduces the risk of ER-positive but not ER-negative breast cancer (Cummings et al., 1999).  Raloxifene  does not alleviate the vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause. Adverse effects include hot flashes and leg cramps and a 3-fold increase in deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (Cummings et al., 1999). — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[38] de novo from basic substrates in the placenta. Instead, they are formed almost entirely from androgenic steroid compounds,  dehydroepiandrosterone  and  16-­hydroxyde- hydroepiandrosterone,  which are formed in the mother’s adrenal glands and in the fetus’s adrenal glands. These weak androgens are transported by the blood to the pla­ centa and converted by the trophoblast cells into estra­ diol, estrone, and estriol. The cortices of the fetal adrenal glands are extremely large, and about 80% consists of a so-­ called  fetal zone,  the primary function of which seems to be to secrete dehydroepiandrosterone during pregnancy. Function of Estrogen in Pregnancy.  In  Chapter 82 , we pointed out that estrogens exert mainly a proliferative function on most reproductive and associated organs of the mother. During pregnancy, the extreme quantities of estrogens cause (1) enlargement of the mother’s uterus, (2) enlargement of the mother’s breasts and growth of the breast ductal structure, and (3) enlargement of the moth­ er’s female external genitalia. The estrogens also relax the pelvic ligaments of the mother, so the sacroiliac joints become relatively limber, and the symphysis pubis becomes elastic. These changes allow easier passage of the fetus through the birth canal. There is reason to believe that estrogens also affect many general aspects of fetal development during pregnancy— for example, by affecting the rate of cell reproduction in the early embryo. SECRETION OF PROGESTERONE BY THE PLACENTA Progesterone is just as essential as estrogen for a success­ ful pregnancy. In addition to being secreted in moderate Figure 83-­7.   Rates of secretion of estrogens  (blue curve)  and progesterone  (black curve)  and con­ centration of human chorionic gonadotropin  (red curve)  at different stages of pregnancy. 0 4 8 12 16 20 Human chorionic gonadotropin Progesterone Estrogens 24 28 32 36 40 Ovulation 0 0 24 22 20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 300 200 100 120 100 80 60 40 20 Duration of pregnancy (weeks after last menstruation) Human chorionic gonadotropin (IU/ml) Progesterone (mg/24 hr) Estrogens (mg/24 hr estradiol equivalent) Parturition Chapter 83   Pregnancy and Lactation 1051 U N I T  X I V quantities by the corpus luteum at the beginning of preg­ nancy, progesterone is secreted later in tremendous quan­ tities by the placenta, as shown in  Figure 83-­7 . The following special effects of progesterone are essen­ tial for the normal progression of pregnancy: 1.	 Progesterone causes decidual cells to develop in the uterine endometrium. These cells play an important role in nutrition of the early embryo. 2.	 Progesterone decreases contractility of the preg­ nant uterus, thus preventing uterine contractions from causing spontaneous abortion. 3.	 Progesterone contributes to development of the conceptus even before implantation because it spe­ cifically increases secretions of the mother’s fallo­ pian tubes and uterus to provide appropriate nutri­ tion for the developing  morula  (the spherical mass of 16 to 32 blastomeres formed before the blastula) and  blastocyst.  Progesterone may also affect cell cleavage in the early developing embryo. 4.	 The progesterone secreted during pregnancy helps estrogen prepare the mother’s breasts for lactation, which is discussed later in this chapter. HUMAN CHORIONIC SOMATOMAMMOTROPIN Human chorionic somatomammotropin,  a protein hor­ mone with a molecular weight of about 22,000, begins to be secreted by the placenta at about the fifth week of pregnancy. Secretion of this hormone increases progres­ sively throughout the remainder of pregnancy in direct proportion to the weight of the placenta. Although the functions of chorionic somatomammotropin are uncer­ tain, it is secreted in quantities several times greater than that of all the other pregnancy hormones combined. It has several possible important effects. First, when administered to several types of animals, human chorionic somatomammotropin causes at least partial development of the animal’s breasts and in some cases causes lactation. Because this was the first function of the hormone that was discovered, it was first named human placental lactogen  and was believed to have func­ tions similar to those of prolactin. However, attempts to use it to promote lactation in humans have not been successful. Second, this hormone has weak actions similar to those of growth hormone, causing formation of tissue proteins in the same way that growth hormone does. It also has a chemical structure similar to that of growth hormone, but 100 times as much human chorionic somatomammotro­ pin as growth hormone is required to promote growth. Third, human chorionic somatomammotropin causes decreased insulin sensitivity and decreased utilization of glucose in the mother, thereby making larger quantities of glucose available to the fetus. Because glucose is the major substrate used by the fetus to energize its growth, the pos­ sible importance of such a hormonal effect is obvious. Further, the hormone promotes the release of free fatty acids from fat stores of the mother, thus providing this alternative source of energy for the mother’s metabolism during pregnancy. Therefore, it appears that human cho­ rionic somatomammotropin is a general metabolic hor­ mone that has specific nutritional implications for the mother and the fetus. Other Hormonal Factors in Pregnancy Almost all the nonsexual endocrine glands of the mother also react markedly to pregnancy. This reaction results mainly from the increased metabolic load on the mother but also, to some extent, from the effects of placental hor­ mones on the pituitary and other glands. The following ef­ fects are some of the most notable. Pituitary Secretion .  The anterior pituitary gland of the mother enlarges at least 50% during pregnancy and increas­ es its production of  adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH), thyrotropin,  and  prolactin.  Conversely, pituitary secretion of follicle-­stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone is almost totally suppressed as a result of the inhibitory ef­ fects of estrogens and progesterone from the placenta. Increased Corticosteroid Secretion .  The rate of adreno­ cortical secretion of  glucocorticoids  is moderately increased throughout pregnancy. It is possible that these glucocorti­ coids help mobilize amino acids from the mother’s tissues to be used for synthesis of fetal tissues. Pregnant women usually have about a 2-­fold increase in  aldosterone  secretion ,  reaching a peak at the end of ges­ tation. This increase, along with the actions of estrogens, causes a tendency for even a normal pregnant woman to — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 83 - Pregnancy and Lactation, Hormonal Factors in Pregnancy, Halaman 996, 997
[39] lar free cholesterol is esterified before triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (chy­ lomicrons and very low-density lipoproteins [VLDLs]) are assembled. Chylomicrons enter the systemic circulation via the thoracic duct. Chylomicron triglycerides are then metabolized to free fatty acids by an extracellular lipoprotein lipase (LPL) at the capillary luminal surface of tissues that synthesize LPL (see Figure 37–1), including adipose tissue, skeletal and cardiac muscle, and breast tissue of lactat­ ing women. The resulting free fatty acids are taken up and used by the adjacent tissues. The interaction of chylomicrons and LPL requires apo C-II as a cofactor. Chylomicron Remnants LPL-mediated removal of much of the dietary triglycerides generates the chylomicron remnants , which contain all of the dietary cholesterol. Chy­ lomicron remnants detach from the capillary surface and are removed from the circulation by the liver within minutes (see Figure 37–1). First, the remnants are sequestered by the interaction of apo E with heparan sulfate proteoglycans on the surface of hepatocytes and are processed by the hepatic lipase (HL), further reducing the remnant triglyceride content. Next, apo E mediates remnant uptake by interacting with the hepatic low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor or the LDL receptor– related protein (LRP). During the initial hydrolysis of chylomicron triglycerides by LPL, apo A-I and phospholipids are shed from the surface of chylomicrons and remain in the plasma. This is one mechanism by which nascent (precur­ sor) HDL is generated (see Figure 37–2). Chylomicron remnants are not precursors of LDL, but the dietary cholesterol delivered to the liver by remnants increases plasma low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. Increased liver cholesterol suppresses steroid receptor element binding protein–regulated expression of proprotein convertase subtilisin/ kexin type 9 (PCSK9), thus reducing LDL receptor–mediated catabolism of LDL by the liver (see PCSK9 Inhibitors below for additional details). Very Low-Density Lipoproteins The VLDLs are produced in the liver when triglyceride production is stimulated by an increased flux of free fatty acids or by increased  de novo synthesis of fatty acids by the liver. Apo B-100, apo E, and apo C-I, C-II, and C-III are synthesized constitutively by the liver and incorporated into VLDLs (see Table 37–3). Triglycerides are synthesized in the endoplas­ mic reticulum and, along with other lipid constituents, are transferred by the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) to the site in the endoplasmic reticulum where newly synthesized apo B-100 is available to form nascent (precursor) VLDL. Small amounts of apo E and the C apoproteins are incorporated into nascent particles within the liver before secretion, but most of these apoproteins are acquired from plasma HDL after the VLDLs are secreted by the liver. Mutations of MTP that result in the inability of triglycerides to be transferred to either apo B-100 in the liver or apo B-48 in the intestine prevent VLDL and chylomicron produc­ tion and cause the genetic disorder  abetalipoproteinemia . Plasma VLDL is catabolized by LPL in the capillary beds in a process similar to the lipolytic processing of chylomicrons (see Figure 37–1). When triglyceride hydrolysis is nearly complete, the VLDL remnants, usually termed  IDLs , are released from the capillary endothelium and reenter the circulation. Apo B-100–containing small VLDLs and IDLs, which have a  t 1/2  of less than 30 min, have two potential fates. About 40% to 60% are cleared from the plasma by the liver via apo B-100– and apo E–mediated interaction with LDL receptors and LRP. LPL and HL con­ vert the remainder of the IDLs to LDLs by removal of additional triglyc­ erides. The C apoproteins, apo E, and apo A-V redistribute to HDL. Apolipoprotein E plays a major role in the metabolism of triglyceride- rich lipoproteins (chylomicrons, chylomicron remnants, VLDLs, and IDLs). About half of the apo E in the plasma of fasting subjects is associ­ ated with triglyceride-rich lipoproteins, and the other half is a constituent of HDL. Low-Density Lipoproteins Virtually all LDL particles in the circulation are derived from VLDL. The LDL particles have a  t 1/2  of 1.5 to 2 days. In subjects without hypertriglyc­ eridemia, two-thirds of plasma cholesterol is found in the LDL. Plasma clearance of LDL is mediated primarily by LDL receptors (apo B-100 binds LDL to its receptor); a small component is mediated by nonrecep­ tor clearance mechanisms. 731 SECTION III MODULATION OF PULMONARY, RENAL, AND CARDIOVASCULAR TABLE 37–1   ■   COMPARISON OF KEY CLINICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF CHOLESTEROL IN ADULTS ATPIII 2004 ACC/AHA 2014 AHA/ACC 2018 ACC/AHA 2019 Risk assessment strategy 10-year FRS; CHD risk factors 10-year PCE 10-year or lifetime PCE 10-year or lifetime PCE Candidates for treatment Patients above LDL-C goal Patients in four statin benefit groups Patients above LDL-C goal Primary prevention in all patients Recommended statin intensity Titrated to achieve LDL-C goal Moderate-to-high intensity Moderate-to-high intensity (may be titrated to achieve a specific LDL-C percent reduction goal) Moderate-to-high intensity (may be titrated to achieve a specific LDL-C percent reduction goal) Recommendations Risk groups and LDL-C goals: • High risk if CHD, risk equivalent, or FRS ≥20% (LDL-C goal <100 mg/dL; <70 mg/dL optional) • Moderate-high risk if ≥2 risk factors or FRS 10% to <20% (LDL-C goal <130 mg/dL; <100 mg/dL optional) • Moderate risk if ≥2 risk factors or FRS <10% (LDL-C goal <130 mg/dL; therapy started if LDL-C >160 mg/dL) • Lower risk if 0 or 1 risk factor (LDL-C goal <160 mg/dL; therapy started if LDL-C >190 mg/dL) Four statin benefit groups: • If ≥21 years old, clinical ASCVD, high-intensity statin (or moderate, if >75 years old) • If ≥21 years old and LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, high-intensity statin • If 40–75 years old with DM and LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, moderate-intensity statin (or high- intensity if ASCVD ≥7.5%) • If 40–75 years old with LDL-C 70–189 mg/dL, moderate- to high-intensity statin if ASCVD ≥7.5% Risk groups and LDL-C goals: • Primary Prevention (ages 40–75 years): • If LDL-C ≥190 mg/dL, high-intensity statin recommended regardless of ASCVD risk • If patient has DM, moderate-intensity statin recommended regardless of ASCVD risk • High risk if ASCVD ≥20% (LDL-C goal reduction of ≥50%) • Intermediate risk if ASCVD ≥7.5% to <20% + risk factors present (LDL-C goal reduction of 30%–49%) — Laurence L.

[41] entire pelvis for load bearing. In the absence of testoster­ one, the male pelvis develops into a pelvis that is similar to that of the female. Because of the ability of testosterone to increase the size and strength of bones, it is sometimes used in older men to treat osteoporosis. When great quantities of testosterone (or any other androgen) are secreted abnormally in the still-­growing child, the rate of bone growth increases markedly, caus­ ing a spurt in total body height. However, the testosterone also causes the epiphyses of the long bones to unite with the shafts of the bones at an early age. Therefore, despite the rapidity of growth, this early uniting of the epiphyses prevents the person from growing as tall as he would have grown had testosterone not been secreted at all. Even in normal men, the final adult height is slightly less than that which occurs in males castrated before puberty. Chapter 81   Reproductive and Hormonal Functions of the Male (and Function of the Pineal Gland) 1021 U N I T  X I V Testosterone Increases the Basal Metabolic Rate.  In­ jection of large quantities of testosterone can increase the basal metabolic rate by as much as 15%. Also, even the usual quantity of testosterone secreted by the testes dur­ ing adolescence and early adult life increases the rate of metabolism some 5% to 10% above the value that it would be were the testes not active. This increased metabolic rate is possibly an indirect result of the effect of testoster­ one on protein anabolism, with the increased quantity of proteins—the enzymes, especially—increasing activities of all cells. Testosterone Increases Red Blood Cells.  When nor­ mal quantities of testosterone are injected into a castrated adult, the number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter of blood increases 15% to 20%. Also, the average man has about 700,000 more red blood cells per cubic millimeter than the average woman. Despite the strong association of testosterone and increased hematocrit, testosterone does not appear to directly increase erythropoietin levels or have a direct effect on red blood cell production. The effect of testosterone to increase red blood cell production may be at least partly indirect because of the increased metabolic rate that occurs after testosterone administration. Effect on Electrolyte and Water Balance.  As pointed out in  Chapter 78 , many steroid hormones can increase the reabsorption of sodium in the distal tubules of the kidneys. Testosterone also has such an effect, but only to a minor degree in comparison with the adrenal miner­ alocorticoids. Nevertheless, after puberty, the blood and extracellular fluid volumes of the male in relation to body weight increase as much as 5% to 10%. BASIC INTRACELLULAR MECHANISM OF ACTION OF TESTOSTERONE Most of the effects of testosterone result basically from increased rate of protein formation in the target cells. In the prostate gland, for example, testosterone enters the prostatic cells within a few minutes after secretion. Then it is most often converted, under the influence of the intracellular enzyme 5 α -­reductase, to  dihydrotestos­ terone  which binds with a cytoplasmic “receptor protein.” This combination migrates to the cell nucleus where it binds with a nuclear protein and induces DNA-­RNA transcription. Within 30 minutes, RNA polymerase has become activated, and the concentration of RNA begins to increase in the prostatic cells, which is followed by a progressive increase in cellular protein. After several days, the quantity of DNA in the prostate gland has also increased, and a simultaneous increase in the number of prostatic cells has occurred. Testosterone stimulates production of proteins virtu­ ally everywhere in the body, although more specifically affecting the proteins in “target” organs or tissues respon­ sible for the development of primary and secondary male sexual characteristics. Some studies suggest that testosterone, like other ste­ roidal hormones, may also exert some rapid,  nongenomic effects  that do not require synthesis of new proteins. The physiological role of these nongenomic actions of testos­ terone, however, has yet to be determined. CONTROL OF MALE SEXUAL FUNCTIONS BY HORMONES FROM THE HYPOTHALAMUS AND ANTERIOR PITUITARY GLAND A major share of the control of sexual functions in both the male and the female begins with secretion of gonadotropin-­releasing hormone  (GnRH) by the hypothal­ amus ( Figure 81-­10 ). This hormone stimulates the ante­ rior pituitary gland to secrete two other hormones called gonadotropic hormones:  (1)  luteinizing hormone  (LH) and (2)  follicle-­stimulating hormone  (FSH). In turn, LH is the primary stimulus for the secretion of testosterone by the testes, and FSH mainly stimulates spermatogenesis. Gonadotropin-­Releasing Hormone Increases Secretion of Luteinizing Hormone and Follicle-­Stimulating Hormone GnRH is a 10–amino acid peptide secreted by neu­ rons whose cell bodies are located in the  arcuate nuclei of the hypothalamus . The endings of these neu­ rons terminate mainly in the median eminence of the hypothalamus, where they release GnRH into the hypothalamic-­hypophysial portal vascular system. The GnRH is then transported to the anterior pituitary gland in the hypophysial portal blood and stimulates release of the two gonadotropins, LH and FSH. GnRH is secreted intermittently a few minutes at a time once every 1 to 3 hours. The intensity of this hor­ mone’s stimulus is determined in two ways: (1) by the fre­ quency of these cycles of secretion and (2) by the quantity of GnRH released with each cycle. Secretion of LH by the anterior pituitary gland is also cyclical, with LH following fairly faithfully the pulsatile release of GnRH. In contrast, FSH secretion increases and decreases only slightly with each fluctuation of GnRH secretion; instead, it changes more slowly over a period of many hours in response to longer-­term changes in GnRH. Because of the much closer relation between GnRH secretion and LH secretion, GnRH is also widely known as  LH-­releasing hormone. Gonadotropic Hormones: Luteinizing Hormone and Follicle-­Stimulating Hormone Both of the gonadotropic hormones, LH and FSH, are secreted by the same cells, called  gonadotropes,  in the anterior pituitary gland. In the absence of GnRH secre­ tion from the hypothalamus, the gonadotropes in the pituitary gland secrete almost no LH or FSH.

[42] testosterone . These glands can also synthesize their own sterols and then form hormones from them, as discussed in the chapters on endocrinology. A large amount of cholesterol is precipitated in the corneum of the skin. This cholesterol, along with other li­ pids, makes the skin highly resistant to the absorption of water-­soluble substances and to the action of many chemi­ cal agents because cholesterol and the other skin lipids are highly inert to acids and to many solvents that might other­ wise easily penetrate the body. Also, these lipid substances help prevent water evaporation from the skin; without this protection, the amount of evaporation can be 5 to 10 lit­ ers per day (as occurs in patients with burns who have lost their skin) instead of the usual 300 to 400 milliliters. Cellular Structural Functions of Phospholipids and Cholesterol—Especially for Membranes .  The previously mentioned uses of phospholipids and cholesterol are of only minor importance in comparison with their function of forming specialized structures, mainly membranes, in all cells of the body. In  Chapter 2 , it was pointed out that large quantities of phospholipids and cholesterol are pre­ sent in both the cell membrane and the membranes of the internal organelles of all cells. It is also known that the  ratio of membrane cholesterol to phospholipids is especially im­ portant in determining the fluidity of cell membranes. For membranes to be formed, substances that are not soluble in water must be available. In general, the only substances in the body that are not soluble in water (be­ sides the inorganic substances of bone) are the lipids and some proteins. Thus, the physical integrity of cells eve­ rywhere in the body is based mainly on phospholipids, cholesterol, and certain insoluble proteins. The polar charges on the phospholipids also reduce the interfacial tension between the cell membranes and the surround­ ing fluids. Another fact that indicates the importance of phos­ pholipids and cholesterol for the formation of structural elements of the cells is the slow turnover rates of these substances in most non-­hepatic tissues—turnover rates measured in months or years. For instance, their function in brain cells to provide memory processes is related main­ ly to their indestructible physical properties. Atherosclerosis Atherosclerosis  is a disease of the large and intermediate-­ sized arteries in which fatty lesions called  atheromatous plaques  develop on the inside surfaces of the arterial walls. Arteriosclerosis , in contrast, is a general term that refers to thickened and stiffened blood vessels of all sizes. One abnormality that can be measured very early in blood vessels that later become atherosclerotic is  damage to the vascular endothelium . This damage, in turn, increas­ es the expression of adhesion molecules on endothelial cells and decreases their ability to release nitric oxide and other substances that help prevent adhesion of macromolecules, platelets, and monocytes to the endothelium. After damage to the vascular endothelium occurs, circulating monocytes and lipids (mostly LDLs) begin to accumulate at the site of injury ( Figure 69-­8 A ). The monocytes cross the endothe­ lium, enter the  intima  of the vessel wall, and differentiate to become  macrophages , which then ingest and oxidize the accumulated lipoproteins, giving the macrophages a foam­ like appearance. These  macrophage foam cells  then aggre­ gate on the blood vessel and form a visible  fatty streak . With time, the fatty streaks grow larger and coalesce, and the surrounding fibrous and smooth muscle tissues prolifer­ ate to form larger and larger plaques (see  Figure 69-­8 B ). Also, the macrophages release substances that cause  inflammation and further proliferation of smooth muscle and fibrous tissue on the inside surfaces of the arterial wall. The lipid deposits plus the cellular proliferation can become so large that the plaque bulges into the lumen of the artery and greatly reduces blood flow, sometimes completely occluding the vessel. Even without occlusion, the fibroblasts of the plaque eventually de­ posit extensive amounts of dense connective tissue;  sclerosis (fibrosis)  becomes so great that the arteries become stiff. Still later, calcium salts often precipitate with the cholesterol and other lipids of the plaques, leading to bony-­hard calcifications that can make the arteries rigid tubes. Both of these later stag­ es of the disease are called “hardening of the arteries.” Atherosclerotic arteries lose most of their distensibility, and because of the degenerative areas in their walls, they are easily ruptured. Also, where the plaques protrude into the flowing blood, their rough surfaces can cause blood clots to develop, with resultant thrombus or embolus formation (see  Chapter 37 ), leading to a sudden blockage of all blood flow in the artery. Almost half of all deaths in the United States and Eu­ rope are due to vascular disease. About two-thirds of these deaths are caused by thrombosis of one or more coronary arteries. The remaining one-third are caused by thrombosis or hemorrhage of vessels in other organs of the body, espe­ cially the brain (causing strokes), but also the kidneys, liver, gastrointestinal tract, limbs, and so forth. Roles of Cholesterol and Lipoproteins in Atherosclerosis Increased Low-­Density Lipoproteins .  An important factor in causing atherosclerosis is a high blood plasma concentra­ tion of cholesterol in the form of LDLs. The plasma concen­ tration of these high-­cholesterol LDLs is increased by several factors, especially by eating highly saturated fat in the daily diet, obesity, and physical inactivity. To a much lesser extent, eating excess cholesterol may also raise plasma levels of LDLs. Familial Hypercholesterolemia .  In 80% to 90% of pa­ tients with  familial hypercholesterolemia , the person inher­ its defective genes for the formation of LDL receptors on the membrane surfaces of the body’s cells. In the absence of these receptors, the liver cannot absorb either IDL or LDL.

Hormone binds to its receptor in the cell membrane, producing a conformational change in the  α q  subunit (Step 1).

The mechanism involves binding of hormone to a receptor and coupling via a G q  protein to phospholipase C. Intracellular levels of IP 3  and Ca 2 +  are increased, producing the final physiologic actions. The steps in the phospholipase C (IP 3 /Ca 2 + ) mechanism are shown in  Figure 9.5 .

These so-called catalytic receptors  include guanylyl cyclase, serine/ threonine kinases, tyrosine kinases, and tyrosine kinase–associated receptors. Guanylyl cyclase catalyzes the generation of cGMP from GTP. The kinases phos- phorylate serine, threonine, or tyrosine on proteins and thus add negative charge in the form of the phosphate group; phosphorylation of target proteins results in conformational changes that are responsible for the hormone’s physiologic actions. Guanylyl Cyclase Hormones acting through the guanylyl cyclase mecha- nism are also listed in  Table 9.3 .  Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)  and related natriuretic peptides act through a  receptor  guanylyl cyclase mechanism as follows (see Chapters 4 and 6). The extracellular domain of the receptor has a binding site for ANP, while the intracellular domain of the receptor has guanylyl cyclase activity. Binding of ANP causes activa- tion of guanylyl cyclase and conversion of GTP to cGMP. cGMP then activates cGMP-dependent kinase, which phosphorylates the proteins responsible for ANP’s physiologic actions. Nitric oxide (NO)  acts through a  cytosolic  guanylyl cyclase as follows (see Chapter 4). NO synthase in vascular endothelial cells cleaves arginine into citrul- line and NO. The just-synthesized NO diffuses out of the endothelial cells into nearby vascular smooth muscle cells, where it binds to and activates soluble, or cytosolic, guanylyl cyclase.

U N I T  X I V 973 The pancreas, in addition to its digestive functions, secretes two major hormones,  insulin  and  glucagon , that are crucial for normal regulation of glucose, lipid, and protein metabolism. Although the pancreas secretes other hormones, such as  amylin, somatostatin,  and  pancreatic polypeptide,  their functions are not as well established. The main purpose of this chapter is to discuss the physi­ ological roles of insulin and glucagon and the pathophysi­ ology of diseases, especially  diabetes mellitus , caused by abnormal secretion or activity of these hormones. Physiological Anatomy of the Pancreas The pancreas is composed of two major types of tissues, as shown in  Figure 79-­1 : (1) the  acini,  which secrete digestive juices into the duodenum, and (2) the  islets of Langerhans, which secrete insulin and glucagon directly into the blood. The digestive secretions of the pancreas are discussed in Chapter 65 . The human pancreas has 1 to 2 million islets of Langer­ hans. Each islet is only about 0.3 millimeter in diameter and is organized around small capillaries, into which its cells secrete their hormones. The islets contain three major types of cells— alpha, beta,  and  delta  cells—that are distinguished from one another by their morphological and staining characteristics. The beta cells, constituting about 60% of all the cells of the islets, lie mainly in the middle of each islet and secrete insulin  and  amylin,  a hormone that is often secreted in parallel with insulin, although its function is not well un­ derstood. The alpha cells, about 25% of the total, secrete glucagon,  and the delta cells, about 10% of the total, secrete somatostatin.  In addition, at least one other type of cell, the PP cell , is present in small numbers in the islets and se­ cretes a hormone called  pancreatic polypeptide. The close interrelations among these cell types in the islets of Langerhans allow cell-­to-­cell communication and direct control of secretion of some of the hormones by the other hormones. For example, insulin inhibits glucagon se­ cretion, amylin inhibits insulin secretion, and somatostatin inhibits the secretion of both insulin and glucagon. INSULIN AND ITS METABOLIC EFFECTS Insulin was first isolated from the pancreas in 1922 by Banting and Best, and almost overnight rescued patients with severe cases of diabetes mellitus from a rapid decline in health and early death. Historically, insulin has been associated with “blood sugar,” and true enough, insulin has profound effects on carbohydrate metabolism. However, abnormalities of fat metabolism that cause conditions such as acidosis and arteriosclerosis are also important causes of morbidity and death in patients with diabetes mellitus. Patients with prolonged, untreated diabetes have diminished ability to synthesize proteins which leads to wasting of the tissues and many cellular functional disor­ ders. Therefore, it is clear that insulin affects fat and pro­ tein metabolism almost as much as it affects carbohydrate metabolism. INSULIN IS A HORMONE ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY ABUNDANCE As we discuss insulin in the next few pages, it will become apparent that insulin secretion is associated with energy abundance. That is, when a person’s diet includes a great abundance of foods that provide energy, especially excess amounts of carbohydrates, insulin secretion increases. In turn, the insulin plays an important role in storing the excess energy. In the case of excess carbohydrates, it causes them to be stored as glycogen, mainly in the liver and muscles. Furthermore, all the excess carbohydrates — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 78 - Adrenocortical Hormones, 79 - Insulin, Glucagon, and Diabetes Mellitus, Regulation of Cortisol Secretion by Adrenocorticotropic Hormone from the Pituitary Gland, Insulin and its Metabolic Effects, Halaman 922, 921, 920
[45] Secretion by the Corpus Luteum: An Additional Func­ tion of Luteinizing Hormone.  The corpus luteum is a highly secretory organ, secreting large amounts of  pro­ gesterone  and  estrogen.  Once LH (mainly that secreted during the ovulatory surge) has acted on the granulosa and theca cells to cause luteinization, the newly formed lutein cells go through a sequence of (1) proliferation, (2) enlargement, and (3) secretion, followed by (4) degen­ eration. All this occurs in about 12 days. As discussed in  Chapter 83 , another hormone with almost exactly the same properties as LH,  chorionic gonadotropin,  which is secreted by the placenta, can act on the corpus luteum to prolong its life—usually maintaining it for at least the first 2 to 4 months of pregnancy. Involution of the Corpus Luteum and Onset of the Next Ovarian Cycle.  Estrogen in particular and proges­ terone to a lesser extent, secreted by the corpus luteum during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle, have strong feedback effects on the anterior pituitary gland to main­ tain low secretory rates of FSH and LH. In addition, the lutein cells secrete small amounts of the hormone  inhibin,  the same as the inhibin secreted by the Sertoli cells of the male testes. This hormone inhibits FSH secretion by the anterior pituitary gland. Low blood concentrations of FSH and LH result, and loss of these hormones finally causes the corpus luteum to degener­ ate completely, a process called  involution  of the corpus luteum. Final involution normally occurs at the end of almost exactly 12 days of corpus luteum life, which is around the 26th day of the normal female sexual cycle, 2 days before menstruation begins. At this time, the sud­ den cessation of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin secretion by the corpus luteum removes the feedback inhibition of the anterior pituitary gland, allowing it to begin secreting increasing amounts of FSH and LH again. FSH and LH initiate the growth of new follicles, beginning a new ovarian cycle. The paucity of proges­ terone and estrogen secretion at this time also leads to menstruation by the uterus, which will be explained later. SUMMARY About every 28 days, gonadotropic hormones from the anterior pituitary gland cause 8 to 12 new follicles to begin to grow in the ovaries. One of these follicles finally becomes “mature” and ovulates on the 14th day of the cycle. During growth of the follicles, estrogen is mainly secreted. After ovulation, the secretory cells of the ovulating follicle develop into a corpus luteum that secretes large quantities of progesterone and estrogen. After another 2 weeks, the corpus luteum degenerates, whereupon the ovarian hormones estrogen and progesterone decrease greatly, and menstruation begins. A new ovarian cycle then follows. FUNCTIONS OF OVARIAN HORMONES— ESTRADIOL AND PROGESTERONE The two types of ovarian sex hormones are the  estrogens and the  progestins.  By far the most important of the estro­ gens is  estradiol,  and by far the most important progestin is  progesterone.  The estrogens mainly promote prolif­ eration and growth of specific cells in the body that are responsible for development of most secondary sexual characteristics of females. The progestins function mainly to prepare the uterus for pregnancy and the breasts for lactation. CHEMISTRY OF THE SEX HORMONES Estrogens.  In the normal  nonpregnant  female, estrogens are secreted in significant quantities only by the ovaries, although minute amounts are also secreted by the ad­ renal cortices. During  pregnancy,  large quantities of es­ trogens are also secreted by the placenta, as discussed in Chapter 83 . Chapter 82   Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones 1033 U N I T  X I V Only three estrogens are present in significant quan­ tities in the plasma of the human female— β -­estradiol, estrone, and  estriol,  the formulas for which are shown in  Figure 82-­7 . The principal estrogen secreted by the ovaries is  β -­estradiol. Small amounts of estrone are also secreted, but most of this is formed in peripheral tissues from androgens secreted by the adrenal cortices and by ovarian thecal cells. Estriol is a weak estrogen; it is an oxi­ dative product derived from both estradiol and estrone, with the conversion occurring mainly in the liver. The estrogenic potency of  β -­estradiol is 12 times that of estrone and 80 times that of estriol. Considering these relative potencies, one can see that the total estrogenic effect of  β -­estradiol is usually many times that of the other two together. For this reason,  β -­estradiol is considered the major estrogen, although the estrogenic effects of estrone are not negligible. Progestins.  By far the most important of the progestins is progesterone. However, small amounts of another pro­ gestin, 17 α -­hydroxyprogesterone, are secreted along with progesterone and have essentially the same effects. Yet, for practical purposes, progesterone is usually considered to be the only important progestin. In nonpregnant females, progesterone is usually secreted in significant amounts only during the latter half of each ovarian cycle, when it is secreted by the corpus luteum. As discussed in  Chapter 83 , large amounts of proges­ terone are also secreted by the placenta during pregnancy, especially after the fourth month of gestation. Synthesis of the Estrogens and Progestins.  Note from the chemical formulas of the estrogens and progesterone in  Figure 82-­7  that they are all steroids. They are synthe­ sized in the ovaries mainly from cholesterol derived from the blood but also to a slight extent from acetyl coenzyme A, multiple molecules of which can combine to form the appropriate steroid nucleus. During synthesis, mainly progesterone and andro­ gens (testosterone and androstenedione) are syn­ thesized first; then, during the follicular phase of the ovarian cycle, before these two initial hormones can leave the ovaries, almost all the androgens and much of the progesterone are converted into estro­ gens by the enzyme  aromatase  in the granulosa cells. Because the theca cells lack aromatase, they cannot convert androgens to estrogens. However, androgens diffuse out of the theca cells into the adjacent granu­ losa cells, where they are converted to estrogens by aromatase, the activity of which is stimulated by FSH ( Figure 82-­8 ).

[46] and as a vaginal insert for assisted reproductive technology. Esters such as MPA are available for intramuscular or subcutaneous administration, and MPA and  megestrol acetate  may be used orally. The 19-nor steroids have good oral activity because the ethinyl substituent at C17 significantly slows hepatic metabolism. Implants and depot prepa­ rations of synthetic progestins are available in many countries for release over very long periods of time (see section on contraceptives). In the plasma, progesterone is bound by albumin and corticos­ teroid-binding globulin but is not appreciably bound to SHBG. 19-Nor compounds, such as  norethindrone ,  norgestrel , and  desoge­ strel , bind to SHBG and albumin, and esters such as MPA bind pri­ marily to albumin. Total binding of all these synthetic compounds to plasma proteins is extensive, 90% or less, but the proteins involved are compound specific. The elimination  t 1/2  of progesterone is about 5 min, and the hormone is metabolized primarily in the liver to hydroxylated metabolites and their sulfate and glucuronide conjugates, which are eliminated in the urine. A major metabolite specific for progesterone is pregnane-3α,20α-diol; its measurement in urine and plasma is used as an index of endogenous progesterone secretion. The synthetic progestins have much longer  t 1/2 (e.g., ~ 7 h for  norethindrone , 16 h for  norgestrel , 12 h for  gestodene , and 24 h for MPA). The metabolism of synthetic progestins is thought to be primarily hepatic, and elimination is generally via the urine as conjugates and various polar metabolites. Antiprogestins and Progesterone Receptor Modulators The first report of an antiprogestin, RU 38486 (often referred to as RU-486) or  mifepristone , appeared in 1981; this drug is available for the termination of pregnancy (Christin-Maitre et al., 2000). In 2010, the FDA approved  ulipristal acetate , a partial agonist at the progesterone receptor, for emergency contraception. Antiprogestins also have several other potential applications, including to prevent conception, to induce labor, and to treat uterine leiomyomas, endometriosis, meningiomas, and breast cancer (Spitz and Chwalisz, 2000). Mifepristone Chemistry Mifepristone  is a derivative of the 19-norprogestin  norethindrone  contain­ ing a dimethyl-aminophenol substituent at the 11β position. It effectively competes with both progesterone and glucocorticoids for binding to their respective receptors.  Mifepristone  is considered a progesterone receptor modulator (PRM) due to its context-dependent activity. Another widely studied antiprogestin is  onapristone  (or ZK 98299), which is similar in structure to  mifepristone  but contains a methyl substituent in the 13α rather than 13β orientation. More selective PRMs, such as  asoprisnil , are being studied experimentally (DeManno et al., 2003). N O C CCH 3 OH CH 3 MIFEPRISTONE https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 972 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT Pharmacological Effects Mifepristone  acts primarily as a competitive receptor antagonist for both PRs, although it may have some agonist activity in certain contexts. In contrast,  onapristone  appears to be a pure progesterone antagonist. PR complexes of both compounds antagonize the actions of progesterone-PR complexes and appear to preferentially recruit corepressors (Leonhardt and Edwards, 2002). When administered in the early stages of pregnancy,  mifepristone causes decidual breakdown by blockade of uterine PRs. This leads to detachment of the blastocyst, which decreases hCG production. This in turn causes a decrease in progesterone secretion from the corpus luteum, which further accentuates decidual breakdown. Decreased endogenous progesterone coupled with blockade of PRs in the uterus increases uter­ ine prostaglandin (PG) levels and sensitizes the myometrium to their contractile actions.  Mifepristone  also causes cervical softening, which facilitates expulsion of the detached blastocyst. Mifepristone  can delay or prevent ovulation depending on the timing and manner of administration. These effects are due largely to actions on the hypothalamus and pituitary rather than the ovary, although the mechanisms are unclear. If administered for one or several days in the mid- to late-luteal phase, mifepristone  impairs the development of a secretory endometrium and produces menses. PR blockade at this time is the pharmacological equiv­ alent of progesterone withdrawal, and bleeding normally ensues within several days and lasts for 1 to 2 weeks after antiprogestin treatment. Mifepristone  also binds to glucocorticoid and androgen receptors and exerts antiglucocorticoid and antiandrogenic actions. A predominant effect in humans is blockade of the feedback inhibition by cortisol of ade­ nocorticotropic hormone secretion from the pituitary, thus increasing both corticotropin and adrenal steroid levels in the plasma. ADME Mifepristone  is orally active with good bioavailability. Peak plasma levels occur within several hours, and the drug is slowly cleared, with a plasma t 1/2  of 20 to 40 h. In plasma, it is bound by α 1 -acid glycoprotein, which contributes to the drug’s long  t 1/2 . Metabolites are primarily the mono- and didemethylated products (thought to have pharmacological activ­ ity) formed via CYP3A4. The drug undergoes hepatic metabolism and enterohepatic circulation; metabolic products are found predominantly in the feces (Jang and Benet, 1997). Therapeutic Uses Mifepristone , in combination with  misoprostol  or other PGs, is available for the termination of early pregnancy. When  mifepristone  is used to pro­ duce a medical abortion, a PG is given 48 h after the antiprogestin to further increase myometrial contractions and ensure expulsion of the detached blastocyst. Intramuscular  sulprostone , intravaginal  gemeprost , and oral  misoprostol  have been used. The success rate with such regimens is greater than 90% among women with pregnancies of 49 days’ duration or less. The most severe untoward effect is vaginal bleeding, which most often lasts 8 to 17 days but is only rarely (0.1% of patients) severe enough to require blood transfusions. High percentages of women also have experienced abdominal pain and uterine cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea due to the PG. Women receiving chronic glucocorticoid therapy should not be given  mifepristone  because of its antiglucocorticoid activ­ ity. In fact, due to its high affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor, high doses of  mifepristone  can result in adrenal insufficiency, and  mifepristone is FDA-approved for the management of the excess glucocorticoid pro­ duction seen in Cushing syndrome. Ulipristal Chemistry Ulipristal , a derivative of 19-norprogesterone, functions as a selective progesterone receptor modulator, acting as a partial agonist at PRs. Unlike  mifepristone ,  ulipristal  appears to be a relatively weak glucocor­ ticoid antagonist. Pharmacological Effects — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[47] The adrenal medulla is of neuroectodermal origin and secretes the catecholamines epinephrine and norepi- nephrine (see Chapter 2). The  adrenal cortex,  which is in the outer zone of the gland, is of mesodermal origin and has three distinct layers. It composes 80% of the adrenal tissue and secretes adrenocortical steroid hormones. The adrenal cortex differentiates by gestational week 8 and is responsible for the production of fetal adrenal steroids throughout intrauterine life (see Chapter 10). Soon after birth, the fetal adrenal cortex begins to involute, even- tually disappears, and is replaced by the three-layered adult adrenal cortex. Synthesis of Adrenocortical Steroid Hormones The adrenal cortex secretes three classes of steroid hormones: glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens.  Figure 9.21  shows the three layers of the adrenal cortex in relation to the adrenal medulla. The innermost zone of the cortex, called the  zona reticu- laris,  and the middle (and widest) zone, called the  zona fasciculata,  synthesize and secrete glucocorticoids and adrenal androgens. The outermost zone, called the zona glomerulosa,  secretes mineralocorticoids.

The precursor for all adrenocortical steroids is  cho- lesterol.  Most of the cholesterol is provided to the adrenal cortex via the circulation, and small amounts are synthesized  de novo  within the adrenal cortical cells. Cholesterol circulates bound to low-density lipo- proteins. There are receptors for these lipoproteins in the membranes of adrenocortical cells; the lipoprotein- cholesterol complex binds and is transferred into the Biosynthetic Pathways in the Adrenal Cortex Figure 9.23  is a schematic diagram of the biosynthetic pathways of the adrenocortical steroids. As noted earlier, the layers of the adrenal cortex are specialized to synthesize and secrete particular steroid hormones: either glucocorticoids and androgens or mineralo­ corticoids. The  basis for this specialization  is the pres- ence or absence of the enzymes that catalyze various modifications of the steroid nucleus. For example, the zonae reticularis/fasciculata produce androgenic ste- BIOSYNTHESIS OF ADRENOCORTICAL HORMONES Dehydroepiandrosterone Androstenedione Androgens Cortisol Glucocorticoids Aldosterone Mineralocorticoids Cholesterol Pregnenolone 17-Hydroxypregnenolone Progesterone cholesterol desmolase 17 α -hydroxylase 3 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase ACTH 3 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 3 β -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 17-Hydroxyprogesterone 11-Deoxycorticosterone (DOC) 21 β -hydroxylase 21 β -hydroxylase Corticosterone 11 β -hydroxylase 11 β -hydroxylase 17 α -hydroxylase aldosterone synthase 17,20 -lyase 17,20 -lyase Angiotensin II 11-Deoxycortisol Testosterone 17 β -estradiol + + Fig. 9.23    Biosynthetic pathways for glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens in the adrenal cortex.

Metyrapone and ketoconazole are drugs that inhibit glucocorticoid biosynthesis.  Metyrapone inhibits 11 β -hydroxylase, the last step in cortisol synthesis.  Ketoconazole  inhibits several steps in the pathway including cholesterol desmolase, the first step. ♦	  Adrenal androgens (DHEA and androstenedione). DHEA and androstenedione are androgenic steroids produced by the  zonae fasciculata/reticularis. These compounds have weak androgenic activity, but in the testes they are converted to testosterone, a more potent androgen. The precursors for the adrenal androgens are 17-hydroxypregnenolone and 17-hydroxyprogesterone, which are converted to androgens by removal of the C20,21 side chain. In males, adrenal androgens are of little significance; the testes produce their own testosterone from cholesterol and do not require the adrenal precur- sors (see Chapter 10). In females, however, the adrenal cortex is the major source of androgenic compounds. Adrenal androgens have a ketone group at C17 that distinguishes them from cortisol, aldosterone, and testosterone. (Cortisol and aldosterone have side chains at C17. Testosterone has a hydroxyl group at C17.) Thus the major adrenal androgens are called 17-ketosteroids,  which can be measured in the urine. The zonae fasciculata/reticularis also produce small amounts of testosterone and 17 β -estradiol, although the major sources for these hormones are the testes and ovaries, respectively (see Chapter 10). ♦	  Mineralocorticoids (aldosterone).  The major min- eralocorticoid in the body is  aldosterone,  which is synthesized only in the  zona glomerulosa.  The steps required to convert cholesterol to cortico­ sterone are identical to those in the zona fasciculata, and the addition of  aldosterone synthase  in the zona glomerulosa converts corticosterone to aldo- sterone. The zona glomerulosa  does not  produce glucocorticoids for two reasons: (1) Corticosterone, a glucocorticoid, is converted to aldosterone because this zone contains aldosterone synthase, and (2) the zona glomerulosa lacks 17 α -hydroxylase and there- fore is unable to produce cortisol from progesterone. Aldosterone is not the only steroid with miner- alocorticoid activity;  11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) and  corticosterone  also have mineralocorticoid activity. Thus if the mineralocorticoid pathway is blocked  below the level of DOC  (e.g., absence of cell by endocytosis. Inside the cells, cholesterol is esterified and stored in cytoplasmic vesicles until it is needed for synthesis of steroid hormones. The enzymes catalyzing the conversion of choles- terol to active steroid hormones require  cytochrome P-450,  molecular oxygen, and NADPH, which serves — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 9 Endocrine Physiology, Adrenal Medulla and Cortex, Halaman 433, 431, 434, 432
[48] vate the calmodulin system. However, when the calcium ion concentration rises to 10 −6  to 10 −5  mol/L, enough binding occurs to cause all the intracellular actions of calmodulin. This is almost exactly the same amount of calcium ion change in skeletal muscle that is required to activate troponin C, which causes skeletal muscle con- traction, as explained in  Chapter 7 . It is interesting that troponin C is similar to calmodulin in both function and protein structure. HORMONES THAT ACT MAINLY ON THE GENETIC MACHINERY OF THE CELL Steroid Hormones Increase Protein Synthesis Another means by which hormones act, especially steroid hormones, is to cause protein synthesis in target cells. These proteins then function as enzymes, transport pro- teins, or structural proteins, which in turn provide other functions of the cells. The sequence of events in steroid function is essen- tially the following (see  Figure 75-­6 ): 1.	 The steroid hormone diffuses across the cell mem- brane and enters the cytoplasm of the cell, where it binds with a specific  receptor protein. 2.	 The combined receptor protein–hormone then dif- fuses into or is transported into the nucleus. 3.	 The combination binds at specific points on the DNA strands in the chromosomes, which activates the transcription process of specific genes to form mRNA. 4.	 The mRNA diffuses into the cytoplasm, where it promotes the translation process at the ribosomes to form new proteins. To give an example,  aldosterone,  one of the hormones secreted by the adrenal cortex, enters the cytoplasm of renal tubular cells, which contain a specific receptor pro- tein often called the  mineralocorticoid receptor . Therefore, in these cells, the sequence of events cited earlier ensues. After about 45 minutes, proteins begin to appear in the renal tubular cells and promote sodium reabsorption from the tubules and potassium secretion into the tubules. Thus, the full action of the steroid hormone is characteristically delayed for at least 45 minutes—up to several hours or even days. This action is in marked contrast to the rapid actions of some of the peptide and amino acid–derived hormones, such as vasopressin and norepinephrine. Thyroid Hormones Increase Gene Transcription in the Cell Nucleus The thyroid hormones  thyroxine  and  triiodothyronine  cause increased transcription by specific genes in the nucleus.

UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 926 accomplish this increased transcription, these hormones first bind directly with receptor proteins in the nucleus, as discussed in more detail in  Chapter 77  (see  Figure 77-­5 ); these receptors are  activated transcription factors  located within the chromosomal complex, and they control the function of the gene promoters, as explained in  Chapter 3 . The following two features of thyroid hormone func- tion in the nucleus are important: 1.	 They activate the genetic mechanisms for synthesiz- ing many types of intracellular proteins—probably 100 or more. Many of these intracellular proteins are enzymes that promote enhanced intracellular metabolic activity in virtually all cells of the body. 2.	 Once bound to the intranuclear receptors, the thy- roid hormones can continue to express their control functions for days or even weeks. Measurement of Hormone Concentrations in the Blood Most hormones are present in the blood in extremely min- ute quantities; some concentrations are as low as one bil- lionth of a milligram (1 picogram) per milliliter. Therefore, it was difficult to measure these concentrations by the usual chemical means. However, an extremely sensitive method, called  radioimmunoassay,  was developed by Rosalyn Yalow and Solomon Berson in 1959 and revolutionized the meas- urement of hormones, their precursors, and their metabolic end products. More recently, additional methods, such as enzyme-­linked immunosorbent assays , have been developed for accurate, high-­throughput measurements of hormones. Radioimmunoassay The method of performing radioimmunoassay is as follows. First, an antibody that is highly specific for the hormone to be measured is produced. Second, a small quantity of this antibody is (1) mixed with a quantity of fluid from the animal containing the hor- mone to be measured and (2) mixed simultaneously with an appropriate amount of purified standard hormone that has been tagged with a radioactive isotope. However, one specific condition must be met. There must be too little an- tibody to bind completely both the radioactively tagged hor- mone and the hormone in the fluid to be assayed. Therefore, the natural hormone in the assay fluid and the radioactive standard hormone  compete for binding sites  of the antibody. In the process of competing, the quantity of each of the two hormones, the natural and the radioactive, that binds is pro- portional to its concentration in the assay fluid. Third, after binding has reached equilibrium, the antibody-­ hormone complex is separated from the remainder of the so- lution, and the quantity of radioactive hormone bound in this complex is measured by radioactive counting techniques. If a large amount of radioactive hormone has bound with the antibody, it is clear that there was only a small amount of natu- ral hormone to compete with the radioactive hormone, and therefore the concentration of the natural hormone in the as- sayed fluid was small. Conversely, if only a small amount of ra- dioactive hormone has bound, it is clear that there was a large amount of natural hormone to compete for the binding sites. Fourth, to make the assay highly quantitative, the radio- immunoassay procedure is also performed for “standard” solutions of untagged hormone at several concentration levels. Then a “standard curve” is plotted, as shown in  Fig- ure 75-­9 . By comparing the radioactive counts recorded from the “unknown” assay procedures with the standard curve, one can determine within an error of 10% to 15%, the concentration of the hormone in the “unknown” as- sayed fluid.

[49] drugs that lower cholesterol by inhibiting the enzyme HMG-CoA reduc­ tase (see Chapter 37); but other statins, such as  atorvastatin , have also achieved enormous commercial success. Beyond Single-Protein Drug Targets A number of drugs, whether by accident or by design, hit multiple pro­ tein targets, a phenomenon termed  polypharmacology  (Peters, 2013). This phenomenon is particularly common when the target is a mem­ ber of a family of proteins with similar binding sites. For example, the BOX 1–1  ■  Target Validation: The Lesson of Leptin Biological systems frequently contain redundant elements or can alter expression of drug-regulated elements to compensate for the effect of the drug.  In general, the more important the function, the greater the complexity of the system.  For example, many mechanisms control feeding and appetite, and drugs to control obesity have been notoriously difficult to find. The discovery of the hormone leptin, which suppresses appetite, was based on mutations in mice that cause loss of either leptin or its receptor; either kind of mutation results in enormous obesity in both mice and people. Leptin thus appeared to be a marvelous opportunity to treat obesity. However, on investigation, it was discovered that obese individuals have high circulating concentrations of leptin and appear insensitive to its action. https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 6 CHAPTER 1 DRUG DISCOVERY: FROM MEDICINAL PLANTS TO COMPUTER-AIDED DRUG DESIGN full physiological effect of an adrenergic antagonist is determined by its actions across the family of adrenergic receptor types and subtypes. Similarly, many protein kinase inhibitors inhibit multiple kinases, each to a different degree. There are instances where hitting multiple targets is fruitful, such as inhibiting sequential reactions in a series. Modulating multiple proteins in a single biochemical pathway or signaling network overcomes the evolved redundancy of a robust biological system and hence leads to greater efficacy than modulating only one protein. A single compound may, alternatively, hit two entirely different targets in different pathways, although this is more challenging to achieve without going to larger compounds. The analysis of complex molecular systems in relation to drug action is termed  systems pharmacology . Polypharmacology is not always beneficial, and indeed, it can lead to toxicity. Some of the unintended effects of a drug will be termed side effects or even major adverse drug responses. For example, a number of initially promising compounds have proven to bind and inhibit hERG, the K +  channel in the heart that mediates repolarization (the I Kr  current; see Chapter 34); inhibition of hERG can lead to potentially fatal arrhyth­ mias. The hERG channel has, therefore, become a notorious  anti­ target  that must be scrupulously avoided by drug discovery projects (Garrido et al., 2020). Some small-molecule drugs do not bind to proteins at all. For exam­ ple, platinum anticancer drugs, such as  carboplatin , kill cancer cells by binding covalently to DNA; the aminoglycoside antibiotics block bacte­ rial protein synthesis by binding to RNA within the bacterial ribosome; and antiviral nucleoside analogues are incorporated into viral DNA in place of normal nucleosides and then block DNA replication. The drug sugammadex  has both an unusual purpose and an unusual mechanism. Surgical patients often receive not only general anesthesia but also the nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agent  rocuronium , which prevents involuntary movements of skeletal muscle during surgical procedures (see Chapter 13).  Sugammadex , a larger, cup-shaped mole­ cule, binds and sequesters  rocuronium . Thus, injection of  sugammadex rapidly reduces the concentration of unbound  rocuronium  in the blood and promptly reverses paralysis when a procedure is complete. Protein-Drug Binding: Affinity and Allostery A successful drug with a protein target must bind to its target with high affinity so that even a small dose of the drug will yield a blood concen­ tration high enough to bind a large fraction of the targeted protein. If the affinity were low, then a high concentration of drug would be needed for a substantial fraction of the target sites to be occupied, and a large dose of drug would need to be administered, leading to inconvenience and an increased risk of side effects. The affinity of a small molecule for a protein is generally given as the dissociation constant, the concentration of free drug molecules in solution at which 50% of the targeted protein has bound drug; the lower this concentration, the higher the affinity (see Figure 3–3). Drug design projects typically aim for a dissociation con­ stant on the order of 10 –9  mol/L (1 nM); such a “nanomolar drug” is typi­ cally dosed in milligrams to grams per day. A successful drug should also exhibit a high degree of specificity for its target protein, meaning that the drug does not interact with other proteins that could lead to undesired side effects and toxicity. In some cases, the effectiveness of a drug may be influenced by not just the affinity but also the kinetic rate constants for drug-protein binding and dissociation, which determine the drug’s residence time at its receptor (Copeland, 2016). Most drugs bind their targeted proteins via attractive, intermolecular inter­ actions that do not involve a covalent chemical bond. These  noncovalent interactions  typically include: • Hydrogen bonding, in which an electronegative atom with a bound hydrogen atom, such as a hydroxyl group, partly shares its hydrogen with an electronegative atom on the other molecule • Attractive electrostatic interactions between atoms of opposite charge, such as between a negatively charged carboxylic acid belonging to the drug and a positively charged arginine side chain of the protein • The hydrophobic effect, in which nonpolar or “greasy” parts of the drug and protein associate with each other to reduce their energeti­ cally unfavorable exposure to water, much as oil droplets coalesce in salad dressing • Dispersion forces—the attractive part of van der Waals interactions— short-ranged attractive interactions between the instantaneous elec­ trical dipoles that result from the constant fluctuations of negatively charged atomic electron clouds around positively charged atomic nuclei These attractive forces need to overcome the entropic tendency of the drug and protein to wander apart, due to thermal energy. There are also, inevitably, forces that oppose binding and that must be overcome by — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[50] are thus likely to contribute to oral contraceptive action. Oral contracep­ tives seem likely to decrease pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. Estrogens also suppress FSH release from the pituitary during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, and this effect seems likely to contribute to the lack of follicular development in oral contraceptive users. The progestin component may also inhibit the estrogen-induced LH surge at midcycle. Other effects may contribute to a minor extent to the extraordinary effi­ cacy of oral contraceptives. Transit of sperm, the egg, and fertilized ovum are important to establish pregnancy, and steroids are likely to affect transport in the fallopian tube. In the cervix, progestin effects also are likely to produce a thick, viscous mucus to reduce sperm penetration and in the endometrium to produce a state that is not receptive to implanta­ tion. However, it is difficult to assess quantitatively the contributions of these effects because the drugs block ovulation. Progestin-Only Contraceptives.   Progestin-only pills and  levonorgestrel implants are highly efficacious but block ovulation in only 60% to 80% of cycles. Their effectiveness is thought to be due largely to a thickening of cervical mucus, which decreases sperm penetration, and to endome­ trial alterations that impair implantation; such local effects account for the efficacy of IUDs that release progestins. Depot injections of MPA are thought to exert similar effects, but they also yield plasma levels of drug high enough to prevent ovulation in virtually all patients, presumably by decreasing the frequency of GnRH pulses. Intrauterine Devices.   While the contraceptive benefit of the LNg IUS is attributed to the progestin-mediated effects of thickening of cervi­ cal mucous and endometrial alterations, the contraceptive mechanism of the copper IUD is related to an inflammatory reaction within the endometrium that impairs sperm viability, motility, and fertilization. Untoward Effects Combination Oral Contraceptives.   Untoward effects of early hor­ monal contraceptives fell into several major categories: adverse car­ diovascular effects, including hypertension, myocardial infarction, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, and venous thrombosis and embolism; breast, hepatocellular, and cervical cancers; and several endocrine and metabolic effects. The current consensus is that low-dose preparations pose minimal health risks in women who have no predisposing risk factors, and these drugs also provide many beneficial health effects (Burkman et al., 2004). Cardiovascular Effects.   The question of cardiovascular side effects has been reexamined for low-dose oral contraceptives (Burkman et al., 2004). For nonsmokers without other risk factors such as hypertension or dia­ betes, there is no significant increase in the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. There is a 28% increase in relative risk for venous thrombo­ embolism, but the estimated absolute increase is very small because the incidence of these events in women without other predisposing factors is low (e.g., roughly half that associated with the risk of venous thromboembolism in pregnancy). The risk is significantly increased in women who smoke or have other factors that predispose to thrombosis or thromboembolism (Castelli, 1999). Postmarketing epidemiological studies indicated that women using transdermal contraceptives have a higher-than-expected exposure to estrogen and are at increased risk for the development of venous thromboembolism. Early high-dose com­ bination oral contraceptives caused hypertension in 4% to 5% of nor­ motensive women and increased blood pressure in 10% to 15% of those Hormonal Contraception: A Brief History Around the beginning of the 20th century, a number of European scientists, including Beard, Prenant, and Loeb, developed the con­ cept that secretions of the corpus luteum suppressed ovulation dur­ ing pregnancy. The Austrian physiologist Haberlandt then produced temporary sterility in rodents in 1927 by feeding them ovarian and placental extracts—a clear example of an oral contraceptive. In 1937, Makepeace and colleagues demonstrated that pure progesterone blocked ovulation in rabbits, and Astwood and Fevold found a similar effect in rats in 1939. In the 1950s, Pincus, Garcia, and Rock found that progester­ one and 19-norprogestins prevented ovulation in women. Ironi­ cally, this finding grew out of their attempts to treat infertility with estrogen-progestin combinations. The initial findings were that these treatments effectively blocked ovulation in most women. However, concern about cancer and other possible side effects of the estrogen they used (i.e.,  diethylstilbestrol ) led to the use of a progestin alone in their studies. One of the compounds used was  norethynodrel , and early batches of this compound were contaminated with a small amount of mestranol . When  mestranol  was removed, it was noted that treatment with pure  norethynodrel  led to increased breakthrough bleeding and less-consistent inhibition of ovulation.  Mestranol  was thus reincorpo­ rated into the preparation, and this combination was employed in the first large-scale clinical trial of combination oral contraceptives. Clinical studies in the 1950s in Puerto Rico and Haiti established the virtually complete contraceptive success of the  norethynodrel / mestranol  combination. In early 1961, Enovid ( norethynodrel  plus mestranol ; no longer marketed in the U.S.) was the first “Pill” approved by the FDA for use as a contraceptive agent in the U.S.; this was fol­ lowed in 1962 by approval for Ortho-Novum ( norethindrone  plus mestranol ). By 1966, numerous preparations using either  mestranol  or ethinyl estradiol  with a 19-norprogestin were available. In the 1960s, the progestin-only minipill and long-acting injectable preparations were developed and introduced. Millions of women began using oral contraceptives, and frequent reports of untoward effects began appearing in the 1970s. The rec­ ognition that these side effects were dose dependent and the realiza­ tion that estrogens and progestins synergistically inhibited ovulation led to the reduction of doses and the development of low-dose or second-generation contraceptives. The increasing use of biphasic and triphasic preparations throughout the 1980s further reduced steroid dosages; it may be that currently used doses are the lowest that will provide reliable contraception. In the 1990s, the “third-generation” oral contraceptives, containing progestins with reduced androgenic activity (e.g.,  norgestimate  and  desogestrel ), became available in the U.S. after being used in Europe. A variety of contraceptive formula­ tions are currently available, including pills, injections, skin patches, subdermal implants, vaginal rings, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) that release hormones. levonorgestrel  and similarly last 3 years.

[52] hood, the slightest secretion of any sex steroid hormones exerts a strong inhibitory effect on hypothalamic secre­ tion of GnRH. Yet, for reasons still not fully understood, at the time of puberty, the secretion of hypothalamic GnRH breaks through the childhood inhibition and adult sexual life begins. Male Adult Sexual Life and Male Climacteric .  After pu­ berty, gonadotropic hormones are produced by the male pituitary gland for the remainder of life, and at least some spermatogenesis usually continues until death. Many men, however, begin to exhibit slowly decreasing sexual func­ tions in their late 50s or 60s, especially if they smoke or are obese and have associated cardiovascular and metabolic disorders, such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. There is considerable variation in the decline of sexual function, with healthy men continuing to be virile until their 80s and 90s. The slow, gradual decline in sexual function is also re­ lated, in part, to a decrease in testosterone secretion, as shown in  Figure 81-­9 . The decrease in male sexual func­ tion is called the  male climacteric. Abnormalities of Male Sexual Function The Prostate Gland and Its Abnormalities The prostate gland remains relatively small throughout childhood and begins to grow at puberty under the stimu­ lus of testosterone. This gland reaches an almost stationary size by the age of 20 years and remains at this size up to the age of about 50 years. At that time, in some men it begins to involute, along with decreased production of testosterone by the testes. A benign prostatic fibroadenoma frequently develops in the prostate in many older men and can cause urinary obstruction. This hypertrophy is caused not by testosterone but instead by abnormal overgrowth of prostate tissue. Cancer of the prostate gland is a different problem that accounts for about 2% to 3% of all male deaths. Once cancer of the prostate gland occurs, the cancerous cells are usu­ ally stimulated to more rapid growth by testosterone and are inhibited by removal of both testes so that testosterone cannot be formed. Prostatic cancer usually can be inhibited by administration of estrogens. Even some patients who have prostatic cancer that has already metastasized to al­ most all the bones of the body can be successfully treated for a few months to years by removal of the testes, estrogen therapy, or both; after initiation of this therapy, the metas­ tases usually diminish in size, and the bones partially heal. This treatment does not stop the cancer but slows it and sometimes greatly diminishes the severe bone pain. Hypogonadism in the Male When the testes of a male fetus are nonfunctional during fetal life, none of the male sexual characteristics develop in the fetus. Instead, female organs are formed. The reason for this is that the basic genetic characteristic of the fetus, whether male or female, is to form female sexual organs if there are no sex hormones. However, in the presence of tes­ tosterone, formation of female sexual organs is suppressed and male organs are induced instead. When a boy loses his testes before puberty, a state of eu­ nuchism ensues in which he continues to have infantile sex organs and other infantile sexual characteristics through­ out life. The height of an adult eunuch is slightly greater than that of a normal man because the bone epiphyses are slow to unite, although the bones are quite thin and the muscles are considerably weaker than those of a normal man. The voice is childlike, there is no loss of hair on the head, and the normal adult masculine hair distribution on the face and elsewhere does not occur. When a man is castrated after puberty, some of his male secondary sexual characteristics revert to those of a child, and others remain of adult masculine character. The sexual organs regress slightly in size but not to a childlike state, and the voice regresses from the bass quality only slightly. However, there is loss of masculine hair production, loss of the thick masculine bones, and loss of the musculature of the virile male. Also in a castrated adult male, sexual desires are decreased but not lost, provided sexual activities have been practiced previously. Erection can still occur as before, although with less ease, but it is rare that ejaculation can take place, primar­ ily because the semen-­forming organs degenerate and there has been a loss of the testosterone-­driven psychic desire. Some cases of hypogonadism are caused by a genetic inability of the hypothalamus to secrete normal amounts of GnRH. This condition is often associated with a simulta­ neous abnormality of the feeding center of the hypothala­ mus, causing the person to greatly overeat. Consequently, obesity occurs along with eunuchism. A patient with this condition is shown in  Figure 81-­11 ; the condition is called adiposogenital syndrome, Fröhlich’s syndrome,  or  hypotha­ lamic eunuchism. UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 1024 Testicular Tumors and Hypergonadism in the Male Interstitial Leydig cell tumors  develop in rare cases in the testes. These tumors sometimes produce as much as 100 times the normal quantities of testosterone. When such tu­ mors develop in young children, they cause rapid growth of the musculature and bones but also early uniting of the epiphyses, so that the eventual adult height is actually con­ siderably less than that which would have been achieved otherwise. Such interstitial cell tumors also cause excessive development of the male sexual organs, all skeletal mus­ cles, and other male sexual characteristics. In the adult male, small interstitial cell tumors are difficult to diagnose because masculine features are already present. Much more common than interstitial Leydig cell tu­ mors are  tumors of the germinal epithelium.  Because ger­ minal cells are capable of differentiating into almost any type of cell, many of these tumors contain multiple tis­ sues, such as placental tissue, hair, teeth, bone, skin, and so forth, all found together in the same tumorous mass called a  teratoma.  These tumors often secrete few hormones, but if a significant quantity of placental tissue develops in the tumor, it may secrete large quantities of hCG with func­ — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 81 - Reproductive and Hormonal Functions of the Male (and Function of the Pineal Gland), Stages of the Male Sexual Act, Halaman 971, 970
[53] sure and stunting of linear growth. Detection An androgen other than testosterone can be detected by gas chromatog­ raphy and mass spectroscopy if the athlete is still taking it when tested. Exogenous testosterone itself can be detected by one of two methods. One is the T/E ratio, the ratio of testosterone glucuronide to its endoge­ nous epimer, epitestosterone glucuronide, in urine. Administration of exogenous testosterone suppresses secretion of both testosterone and epitestosterone and replaces them with only testosterone, so the T/E ratio is higher than normal. This technique is limited, however, by hete­ rozygosity in the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase that converts testoster­ one to testosterone glucuronide. An athlete who has a deletion of one or both copies of the gene coding for this enzyme and who takes exogenous testosterone will have a much lower T/E ratio than one who has both cop­ ies (Schulze et al., 2008). A second technique for detecting administration of exogenous tes­ tosterone employs gas chromatography-combustion-isotope ratio mass spectrometry to detect the presence of  13 C and  12 C compounds. Urinary steroids with a low  13 C/ 12 C ratio are likely to have originated from phar­ maceutical sources as opposed to endogenous physiological sources (Aguilera et al., 2001). Catabolic and Wasting States Testosterone, because of its anabolic effects, has been used in attempts to ameliorate catabolic and muscle-wasting states, but this has not been generally effective. One exception is in the treatment of muscle wasting associated with AIDS, which often is accompanied by hypogonadism. Treatment of men with AIDS-related muscle wasting and subnormal serum testosterone concentrations increases their muscle mass and strength (Bhasin et al., 2000). Angioedema Chronic androgen treatment of patients with angioedema effectively prevents attacks. The disease is caused by hereditary impairment of C1-esterase inhibitor or acquired development of antibodies against it. The 17α-alkylated androgens (e.g.,  stanozolol ,  danazol ) stimulate hepatic synthesis of the esterase inhibitor. In women, virilization is a potential side effect. In children, virilization and premature epiphyseal closure prevent chronic use of androgens for prophylaxis, although they are used occasionally to treat acute episodes. Alternatively, concentrated C1-esterase inhibitor derived from human plasma may be used for pro­ tection in patients with hereditary angioedema. Blood Dyscrasias Androgens once were employed to attempt to stimulate erythropoiesis in patients with anemias of various etiologies, but the availability of erythro­ poietin has supplanted that use. Androgens, such as  danazol , still are used occasionally as adjunctive treatment of hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura that are refractory to first-line agents. Antiandrogens Because some effects of androgens are undesirable, at least under certain circumstances, agents have been developed specifically to inhibit andro­ gen synthesis or effects. Other drugs, originally developed for different purposes, have been accidentally found to be antiandrogens and now are used intentionally for this indication. See Chapter 73 for a more detailed discussion of androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer. Inhibitors of Testosterone Secretion Analogues of GnRH effectively inhibit testosterone secretion by inhibit­ ing LH secretion. GnRH analogues, given repeatedly, downregulate the GnRH receptor and are available for treatment of prostate cancer. Some antifungal drugs of the imidazole family, such as  ketoconazole (see Chapter 61), inhibit CYPs and thereby block the synthesis of steroid hormones, including testosterone and cortisol. Because they may induce adrenal insufficiency and are associated with hepatotoxicity, these drugs generally are not used to inhibit androgen synthesis but sometimes are employed in cases of glucocorticoid excess (see Chapter 50). Inhibitors of Androgen Action These drugs inhibit the binding of androgens to the AR or inhibit 5α-reductase. Androgen Receptor Antagonists Flutamide, Bicalutamide, Nilutamide, Enzalutamide, Apalutamide and Darolutamide.   Although relatively potent, these AR antagonists have limited efficacy when used alone because the increased LH secre­ tion stimulates higher serum testosterone concentrations. They are used primarily in conjunction with a GnRH analogue in the treatment of met­ astatic prostate cancer (see Chapter 73). In this situation, they block the action of adrenal androgens, which are not inhibited by GnRH analogues. Flutamide  also has been used to treat hirsutism in women; however, its association with hepatotoxicity warrants caution against its use for this cosmetic purpose. Spironolactone.   Spironolactone  (see Chapter 29) is an inhibitor of aldosterone that also is a weak inhibitor of the AR and a weak inhibitor of testosterone synthesis. When the agent is used to treat fluid retention or hypertension in men, gynecomastia is a common side effect. In part because of this adverse effect, the selective mineralocorticoid recep­ tor antagonist  eplerenone  was developed.  Spironolactone  can be used in women to treat hirsutism. Cyproterone Acetate.   Cyproterone acetate  is a progestin and a weak antiandrogen by virtue of binding to the AR. It is moderately effective in reducing hirsutism alone or in combination with an oral contraceptive but is not approved for use in the U.S. 5α-Reductase Inhibitors Finasteride  and  dutasteride  are antagonists of 5α-reductase. They block the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, especially in the male https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 998 CHAPTER 49  ANDROGENS AND THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT external genitalia. These drugs were developed to treat benign prostatic hyperplasia and are approved in the U.S. and many other countries for this purpose. When they are administered to men with moderate-to-se­ vere symptoms due to obstruction of urinary tract outflow, serum and prostatic concentrations of dihydrotestosterone decrease, prostatic vol­ ume decreases, and urine flow rate increases (McConnell et al., 1998). Impotence is a documented, albeit infrequent, side effect of this use. Gynecomastia is a rare side effect.  Finasteride  also is approved for use in the treatment of male pattern baldness and is effective in the treatment of hirsutism. Pharmacological Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction Normal erectile function depends on a combination of many factors, including visual, psychological, hormonal, and neurological factors, that act via the common mechanism of increasing the synthesis of NO by vascular endothelium in the arterioles supplying the corpora cavernosa and in the corpora cavernosa. NO diffuses to adjacent smooth muscle cells and causes vasodilation of arterioles and increased compliance of the cavernosal space, permitting its engorgement with blood. This accu­ mulation of blood also restricts the outflow by compressing the veins against the surrounding sheath ( tunica albuginea ). The overall result is penile erection. — Laurence L.

[54] as well. Without insulin from the pancreas, the body’s cells could use little of the food carbohydrates for energy. And without the sex hormones, sexual development and sexual functions would be absent. CHEMICAL STRUCTURE AND SYNTHESIS OF HORMONES Three general classes of hormones exist: 1.	  Proteins and polypeptides,  including hormones se- creted by the anterior and posterior pituitary gland, the pancreas (insulin and glucagon), the ­parathyroid Introduction to Endocrinology C H A P T E R   7 5 UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 916 gland (parathyroid hormone), and many others (see Table 75-­1 ). 2.	  Steroids  secreted by the adrenal cortex (cortisol and aldosterone), the ovaries (estrogen and progester- one), the testes (testosterone), and the placenta (es- trogen and progesterone). 3.	  Derivatives of the amino acid tyrosine,  secreted by the thyroid (thyroxine and triiodothyronine) and the adrenal medullae (epinephrine and norepineph- rine). There are no known polysaccharides or nu- cleic acid hormones. Polypeptide and Protein Hormones Are Stored in Secretory Vesicles Until Needed.  Most of the hormones in the body are polypeptides and proteins. These hor- mones range in size from small peptides with as few as three amino acids (e.g., thyrotropin-­releasing hormone) to proteins with almost 200 amino acids (e.g., growth hor- mone and prolactin). In general, polypeptides with 100 or more amino acids are called  proteins,  and those with fewer than 100 amino acids are referred to as  peptides. Protein and peptide hormones are synthesized on the rough end of the endoplasmic reticulum of the different endocrine cells, in the same fashion as most other pro- teins ( Figure 75-­2 ). They are usually synthesized first as larger proteins that are not biologically active  (preprohor- mones)  and are cleaved to form smaller  prohormones  in the endoplasmic reticulum. These prohormones are then transferred to the Golgi apparatus for packaging into secretory vesicles. In this process, enzymes in the vesicles cleave the prohormones to produce smaller, biologically active hormones and inactive fragments. The vesicles are stored within the cytoplasm, and many are bound to the cell membrane until their secretion is needed. Secretion of the hormones (as well as the inactive fragments) occurs when the secretory vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and the granular contents are extruded into the interstitial fluid or directly into the blood stream by  exocytosis. In many cases, the stimulus for exocytosis is increased cytosolic calcium concentration caused by depolarization of the plasma membrane. In other cases, stimulation of an endocrine cell surface receptor causes increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and subsequently activation of protein kinases that initiate secretion of the hormone. The peptide hormones are water soluble, allow- ing them to enter the circulatory system easily, where they are carried to their target tissues. Steroid Hormones Are Usually Synthesized From Cholesterol and Are Not Stored.  Steroid hormones have a chemical structure that is similar to cholesterol, and in most cases are synthesized from cholesterol. They are lipid soluble and consist of three cyclohexyl rings and one cyclo- pentyl ring combined into a single structure ( Figure 75-­3 ). Although there is usually very little hormone stor- age in steroid-­producing endocrine cells, large stores of cholesterol esters in cytoplasm vacuoles can be rapidly mobilized for steroid synthesis after a stimulus. Much of the cholesterol in steroid-­producing cells comes from the plasma, but there is also de novo synthesis of cholesterol in steroid-­producing cells. Because steroids are highly lipid soluble, once they are synthesized, they can simply diffuse across the cell membrane and enter the interstitial fluid and then the blood. Amine Hormones Are Derived From Tyrosine.  The two groups of hormones derived from tyrosine, the thy- roid and the adrenal medullary hormones, are formed by the actions of enzymes in the cytoplasmic compart- ments of glandular cells. The thyroid hormones are syn- thesized and stored in the thyroid gland and incorporated into macromolecules of the protein  thyroglobulin,  which is stored in large follicles within the thyroid gland. Hor- mone secretion occurs when the amines are split from Pituitary gland Pineal gland Hypothalamus Thymus gland Parathyroid glands (behind thyroid gland) Thyroid gland Kidney Pancreas Adrenal glands Adipose tissue Stomach Small intestine Testes (male) Ovaries (female) Figure 75-­1.   Anatomical loci of the principal endocrine glands and tissues of the body.

Tamoxifen  and other SERMs such as  raloxifene  are also used for the prevention of breast cancer in high-risk patients such as those with a strong family history or prior nonmalignant breast pathology (Visvanathan et al., 2013). The uses, pharmacology, and mechanism of action of raloxifene  are discussed in Chapter 48. Mechanism of Action.   Tamoxifen  is a competitive inhibitor of the binding of estrogens (e.g., 17β-estradiol) to the ER and antagonizes estrogen- induced proliferation of human breast cancer. There are two subtypes of ERs: ERα and ERβ, which have different tissue distributions and can either homo- or heterodimerize. ERα plays a major role in breast cancer progression and is a prognostic marker; the role of ERβ is unclear. Binding of estrogen and SERMs to the estro­ gen-binding sites of the ERs initiates a change in conformation of the ER, dissociation of the ER from heat-shock proteins, and ER dimeriza­ tion. Dimerization facilitates the binding of the ER to specific DNA estrogen-response elements (EREs) in the vicinity of estrogen-regulated genes. Coregulator proteins interact with the liganded receptor to act as corepressors or coactivators of gene expression (see Chapter 48). Elegant studies of the crystal structure of ERα bound to different ligands indicate that, when an ER agonist is bound to the ER, a conformational change occurs in the ligand-binding pocket that enables helix 12 in this region to provide a docking site for p160 transcriptional coactivators, thereby increasing transcription of target genes. Conversely, the interaction of an estrogen antagonist such as 4-hydroxytamoxifen bound to the ligand binding domain of ER causes a structural rearrangement of helix 12. This alteration in structure reduces transcriptional coactivator binding and favors binding of transcriptional corepressors. The net result is inhibition of estrogen-induced gene tran­ scription (reviewed in Legare and Basik, 2016; Nettles and Greene, 2005). Differences in tissue distribution of the ER subtypes and the relative abundance and activities of different transcriptional coactivators and corepressors likely explain the antagonist response to tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer and its partial agonist activities in noncancerous tissues (see Figure 73–1A) (reviewed in Abderrahman and Jordan, 2019; Green and Carroll, 2007). Organs displaying agonist effects of  tamoxifen  include the uterine endometrium (endometrial hypertrophy, vaginal bleeding, and endome­ trial cancer); the coagulation system (thromboembolism); bone metab­ olism (increase in bone mineral density, which can slow development of osteoporosis); and liver ( tamoxifen  lowers total serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and lipoproteins and raises apolipo­ protein A1 levels). ADME.   Tamoxifen  is given orally once (20 mg) per day. It is readily absorbed following oral administration, with peak concentrations mea­ surable after 3 to 7 h and steady-state levels reached at 4 to 6 weeks. Metabolism of  tamoxifen  is complex and principally involves CYPs 3A4/5 and 2D6 in the formation of  N -desmethyl tamoxifen and CYP2D6 to form 4-hydroxytamoxifen, a more potent metabolite (Figure 73–2). Both metabolites can be further converted to 4-hydroxy- N -desmethyltamoxifen (endoxifen), which retains high affinity for the ER. The parent drug has a terminal  t 1/2  of 7 days. After enterohepatic circulation, glucuronides and other metabolites are excreted in the stool; excretion in the urine is min­ imal. Polymorphisms in CYP2D6 that reduce its activity lead to lower plasma levels of the potent metabolites 4-OH tamoxifen and endoxifen, but whether this leads to inferior efficacy of  tamoxifen  treatment and higher risk of disease relapse is unclear (reviewed in Hertz and Rae, 2016; Tamura et al., 2020). While drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 activity, such as antidepressants, have been postulated to minimize  tamoxifen  activity in breast cancer, more recent studies do not suggest a clinically significant impact (Haque et al., 2016). Therapeutic Uses.   Tamoxifen  is used for the treatment of women with ER+ metastatic breast cancer or following primary excision of an ER+ tumor as an adjuvant treatment to prevent recurrence and extend overall survival. For the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women,  tamox­ ifen  is given for at least 5 years (see Table 73–1).  Tamoxifen  may also be used for postmenopausal women, but AIs are preferred as they are associated with further reductions in the risk of recurrence (Early Breast O Tamoxifen CYP2D6 (CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A) CYP3A4/5 (CYP2C9 + other CYPs) CYP3A4/5 Sulfate metabolites SULT1A1 SULT1A1 N O OH 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen N O N -desmethyl-tamoxifen CYP2D6 N H CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 CH 3 H O OH Endoxifen N Figure 73–2 Tamoxifen and its metabolites. 1441 PHARMACOTHERAPY OF NEOPLASTIC DISEASE SECTION VIII Cancer Trialists’ Collaborative Group, 2015). Recent studies indicate that patients with breast cancer derive modest additional benefit, in terms of disease-free survival, overall survival, and decrease in contralat­ eral breast cancer risk, if  tamoxifen  is taken for up to 10 years or AIs are continued for 5 to 10 years after completion of 5 years of  tamoxifen (Burstein, 2020; Davies et al., 2013; Goss et al., 2016). Although taken for a finite time,  tamoxifen  has persisting long-term benefits (Ekholm et al., 2016).  Tamoxifen  may be taken as sole adjuvant therapy or after adjuvant chemotherapy (see Table 73–1). Alternative or additional anti­ estrogen strategies in the adjuvant treatment of premenopausal women with ER+ breast cancer include oophorectomy or suppression of ovarian function with GnRH analogues in combination with either  tamoxifen or an AI. These combinations, used in premenopausal women, further reduce estrogen stimulation of breast cancer and result in lower rates of disease recurrence in very young women and in higher risk patients receiving chemotherapy (Francis et al., 2015; Pagani et al., 2020). Some studies suggest improved response rates with these combinations in patients with metastatic disease.  Tamoxifen  also is effective (a 40%–50% reduction in tumor incidence) in preventing breast cancer in women at — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[56] pituitary, further integrating the regulation of hormone levels in response to diverse stimuli. Pituitary Hormones and Their Hypothalamic- Releasing Factors The anterior pituitary hormones can be classified into three different groups based on their structural features (Table 46–2): • Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived hormones include  cortico­ tropin  (ACTH) and  α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone  (α-MSH). 925 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY Hypothalamus Ghrelin Growth hormone Muscle IGF-1 Secondary target tissues GHRH SST Anterior pituitary Target tissues Liver Bone Adipocyte – – – – – – + + + Figure 46–2 Growth hormone secretion and actions.  Two hypothalamic fac­ tors, GHRH and SST, stimulate or inhibit the release of GH from the pituitary, respectively. Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), a product of GH action on peripheral tissues, causes negative-feedback inhibition of GH release by acting at the hypothalamus and the pituitary. The actions of GH can be direct or indirect (mediated by IGF-1). See text for discussion of the other agents that modulate GH secretion and of the effects of locally produced IGF-1. Inhibi­ tion, −; stimulation, +. • The glycoprotein hormones include  thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, also called thyrotropin),  luteinizing hormone  (LH, also called lutropin), and  follicle-stimulating hormone  (FSH, also called fol­ litropin). In humans, the glycoprotein hormone family also includes placental  human chorionic gonadotropin  (hCG). The synthesis and release of  anterior pituitary hormones  are influenced by the CNS. Their secretion is positively regulated by a group of pep­ tides referred to as  hypothalamic-releasing hormones  (see Figure 46–1). These include  corticotropin-releasing hormone  (CRH),  growth hormone– releasing hormone  (GHRH),  gonadotropin-releasing hormone  (GnRH), and  thyrotropin-releasing hormone  (TRH).  Somatostatin  (SST), another hypothalamic peptide, negatively regulates secretion of pituitary GH and TSH. The neurotransmitter  dopamine  (DA) inhibits the secretion of PRL by lactotropes. Posterior pituitary hormones,  which are synthesized by hypothalamic neurons and secreted from the neurohypophysis, include  oxytocin  and arginine vasopressin  (also called antidiuretic hormone [ADH]). Arginine vasopressin plays an important role in water homeostasis (see Chapter 29); oxytocin plays important roles in labor and parturition and in milk let­ down as discussed in the sections that follow. In contrast to other anterior pituitary hormone regulatory models, oxytocin is not regulated by feed­ back control. Rather, only the feed-forward component of the axis exists, and secretion is reduced by cessation of the stimulatory input. Growth Hormone and Prolactin Growth hormone and PRL are structurally related members of the soma­ totropic hormone family and share many biological features. The soma­ totropes and lactotropes, the pituitary cells that produce and secrete GH and PRL, respectively, are subject to strong inhibitory input from hypo­ thalamic neurons. For PRL, dopaminergic input is the dominant nega­ tive regulator of secretion. GH and PRL act via membrane receptors that belong to the class 1 cytokine receptor family and modulate target cell function via very similar signal transduction pathways (see Chapter 3). Structures of Growth Hormone and Prolactin Table 46–2 presents some features of the somatotropic family of hor­ mones. GH is secreted by somatotropes as a heterogeneous mixture of peptides. The principal form is a single unglycosylated polypeptide chain of 22 kDa that has two disulfide bonds. Alternative splicing produces a smaller form (~20 kDa) with equal bioactivity that makes up 5% to 10% of circulating GH. Recombinant human GH consists entirely of the 22 kDa form, which allows detection of GH abuse. In the circulation, a 55 kDa protein, which is derived from the extracellular domain of the proteolytically cleaved GHRH receptor, binds approximately 45% of the 22 kDa and 25% of the 20 kDa forms. A second protein unrelated to the GHR also binds approximately 5% to 10% of circulating GH with lower affinity. Bound GH is cleared more slowly and has a biological  t 1/2 about 10 times that of unbound GH, suggesting that the bound hormone may provide a GH reservoir that dampens acute fluctuations in GH levels associated with its pulsatile secretion. Human PRL is synthesized by lactotropes. A portion of the secreted hormone is glycosylated at a single Asn residue. In the circulation, mul­ timeric forms of PRL occur, as do degradation products of 16 kDa and 18 kDa. As with GH, the biological significance of these polymeric and degraded forms is not known.

[57] blood, and increased use of fatty acids for energy; and (3) decreased rate of glucose utilization throughout the body. Thus, in effect, GH enhances body protein, decreases fat stores, and conserves carbohydrates. Growth Hormone Promotes Protein Deposition in Tissues Although the precise mechanisms by which growth hor­ mone increases protein deposition are not fully under­ stood, a series of different effects are known, all of which could lead to enhanced protein deposition. Enhancement of Amino Acid Transport Through the Cell Membranes.  GH directly enhances transport of most amino acids through cell membranes to the interior of the cells. This increases amino acid concentrations in the cells and is presumed to be at least partly responsible for the increased protein synthesis. This control of amino acid transport is similar to the effect of insulin in con­ trolling glucose transport through the membrane, as dis­ cussed in Chapters 68 and 79. Enhancement of RNA Translation to Cause Protein Synthesis by the Ribosomes.  Even when the amino acid concentrations are not increased in the cells, GH still increases RNA translation, causing protein to be synthe­ sized in greater amounts by the ribosomes in the cyto­ plasm. Increased Nuclear Transcription of DNA to Form RNA. Over more prolonged periods (24–48 hours), GH also stim­ ulates transcription of DNA in the nucleus, causing forma­ tion of increased quantities of RNA.

The color figures will appear in color in all electronic versions of this book. protein synthesis and growth if sufficient energy, amino ac­ ids, vitamins, and other requisites for growth are available. In the long run, this may be the most important function of GH. Decreased Catabolism of Protein and Amino Acids. In addition to the increase in protein synthesis, GH de­ creases breakdown of cell protein. A probable reason for this decrease is that GH also mobilizes large quantities of free fatty acids from the adipose tissue, and these are used to supply most of the energy for the body’s cells, thus act­ ing as a potent “protein sparer.” Summary.  GH enhances almost all facets of amino acid uptake and protein synthesis by cells, while at the same time reducing the breakdown of proteins. Growth Hormone Enhances Fat Utilization for Energy GH has a specific effect to cause release of fatty acids from adipose tissue and, therefore, increases the concentration of fatty acids in body fluids. Also, in tissues throughout the body, GH enhances conversion of fatty acids to acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-­CoA) and its subsequent utilization for energy. Therefore, under the influence of GH, fat is used for energy in preference to use of carbohydrates and proteins. The ability of GH to promote fat utilization, together with its protein anabolic effect, causes an increase in lean body mass. However, mobilization of fat by GH requires several hours to occur, whereas enhancement of protein synthesis can begin in minutes under the influence of GH. “Ketogenic” Effect of Excessive Growth Hormone. Under the influence of excessive amounts of GH, fat mo­ bilization from adipose tissue sometimes becomes so great that large quantities of acetoacetic acid are formed by the liver and released into the body fluids, thus causing ketosis.  This excessive mobilization of fat from the adipose tissue also frequently causes a fatty liver. Growth Hormone Decreases Carbohydrate Utilization GH has multiple effects that influence carbohydrate metabolism, including (1) decreased glucose uptake in tissues such as skeletal muscle and fat, (2) increased glu­ cose production by the liver, and (3) increased insulin secretion. Each of these changes results from GH-­induced “insu­ lin resistance,” which attenuates insulin’s actions to stimu­ late uptake and utilization of glucose in skeletal muscle and adipose tissue and to inhibit gluconeogenesis (glu­ cose production) by the liver; this leads to increased blood glucose concentration and a compensatory increase in insulin secretion. For these reasons, GH’s effects are called  diabetogenic,  and excess secretion of GH can pro­ duce metabolic disturbances similar to those found in patients with type 2 (non–insulin-­dependent) diabetes, who are also resistant to the metabolic effects of insulin. However, patients with  acromegaly  who have excess GH secretion are usually lean with little visceral fat whereas patients with type 2 diabetes are frequently overweight with excessive visceral fat which drives insulin resistance. We do not know the precise mechanism by which GH causes insulin resistance and decreased glucose utilization by the cells. However, GH-­induced increases in lipolysis and blood concentrations of fatty acids likely contribute to impairment of insulin’s actions on tissue glucose uti­ lization.

[58] ligand-activated transcription factors. By inhibiting the activation and actions of androgen and estrogen receptors, these drugs block or reduce expression of genes and gene networks that ultimately promote tumor growth and survival. Glucocorticoids are used for their antiproliferative and lympholytic properties in hematologic malignancies and, in other oncological settings, to mitigate untoward responses to other treatments as well as some cancer-related symptoms. The pharmacology of the estrogens and androgens is described in detail in Chapters 48 and 49. Decreasing the actions of these steroid hormones is the therapeutic goal in certain cancers, most notably those of the prostate and breast, because these organs are dependent on steroid hormones for their growth, function, and morphological integrity. Endocrine Therapy of Breast Cancer The presence of the estrogen receptor (ER) and/or progesterone receptor (PR) (ER+/PR+) in female breast cancer tissue identifies the subset of hormone receptor–positive cancers with a greater than 60% likelihood of responding to endocrine therapy. The response rate to antiestrogen treat­ ment is somewhat lower in the subset of patients with tumors that are ER+ or PR+ but also positive for human epidermal growth factor recep­ tor (HER2)/neu amplification. In contrast, ER-negative and PR-negative (ER–/PR–) carcinomas do not respond to endocrine therapy. Antiestro­ gen approaches for the therapy of ER+/PR+ breast cancer include the use of selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERMs), selective estrogen receptor downregulators (SERDs), and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) (Table 73–1 and Figure 73–1A). Historically, high doses of estrogen have been recognized as effective treatment of breast cancer. The growth inhibitory effect of estrogens may be related to their ability to induce apoptosis in endocrine-resistant breast cancer (reviewed in Jordan, 2015). However, interruption of estrogen-induced signaling with SERMs, SERDs, and drugs that reduce estrogen production such as AIs and GnRH/luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone (LHRH) analogues are more effective and better tolerated. These drugs have largely replaced estrogens or progestins for the treatment of breast cancer, although estrogen and progesterone are used occasionally. Male breast cancer is rare and predominantly (>90%) ER+/PR+. Treatment is directed at inhibiting ER with  tamoxifen . There is a paucity of data on the use of AIs or SERDs in males. Initial or acquired resistance to endocrine therapies ( tamoxifen  or AIs) frequently occurs. Multiple mechanisms contribute to endocrine resistance in breast cancer (reviewed in Fan and Jordan, 2019); these mechanisms include loss of ER expression, changes in transcriptional coregulator expression or activity, and hormone-independent activa­ tion of the ER by stress kinase or growth factor–activated cellular kinase 73 Chapter Hormones, Hormone Receptor Antagonists, and Related Agents in the Therapy of Cancer Claudine Isaacs, Kerry L.

As a consequence, this chapter presents relatively few detailed treatment regimens; rather, we refer the reader to the web-based resources of the U.S. FDA (drugs@ fda) and the NCCN (National Comprehensive Cancer Network).

In particular, cross talk between the ER and the HER2/neu pathway has been implicated in  tamoxifen  resistance. In a significant por­ tion of metastatic breast cancers, estrogen deprivation therapy can lead to selection of cancer cells expressing an ER with mutations that allow hormone-independent activation. Acquired ER mutations also contrib­ ute to endocrine therapy–resistant breast cancer growth (reviewed in Jeselsohn et al., 2017). Targeting endocrine-resistant disease harboring ER mutations with SERDs and SERMs is an active area of drug investiga­ tion and development (reviewed in McDonnell et al., 2021). Androgen Deprivation Therapy of Prostate Cancer Androgens are essential for the development and maintenance of the prostate gland. The critical role of androgens in promoting prostate cancer growth was demonstrated in 1941 and led to the awarding of a Nobel Prize in 1966 to Dr. Charles Huggins. Huggins’s findings estab­ lished androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) as the mainstay of treatment for patients with advanced prostate cancer, an approach still used today. ADT is accomplished by surgical castration (bilateral orchiectomy) or “medical” castration, using long-acting GnRH agonist formulations to downregulate GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary or with GnRH antagonists that directly block GnRH receptor-ligand interaction to achieve more rapid suppression of the major circulating androgen, tes­ tosterone (Table 73–2 and Figure 73–1B). ADT results in castrate levels (≤50 ng/dL) of testosterone and hence subsequent reduction of the testos­ terone metabolite, dihydrotestosterone, which binds with highest affinity — Laurence L.

Neuroendocrine Control of the Menstrual Cycle A neuroendocrine cascade involving the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries controls the menstrual cycle (Figure 48–2). A neuronal oscilla­ tor, or “clock,” in the hypothalamus fires at intervals that coincide with bursts of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) release into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal vasculature (see Chapter 46). GnRH inter­ acts with its cognate receptor on pituitary gonadotropes to cause release of LH and FSH. The frequency of the GnRH pulses, which varies in the different phases of the menstrual cycle, controls the relative synthesis of the unique β subunits of FSH and LH. The gonadotropins (LH and FSH) regulate the growth and maturation of the graafian follicle in the ovary and the ovarian production of estro­ gen and progesterone, which exert feedback regulation on the pituitary and hypothalamus. Because the release of GnRH is intermittent, LH and FSH secretion is pulsatile. The pulse  frequency  is determined by the neu­ ral clock (Figure 48–2), termed the  hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator (Knobil, 1981), but the amount of gonadotropin released in each pulse (i.e., the pulse  amplitude ) is largely controlled by the actions of estrogens and progesterone on the pituitary. The intermittent,  pulsatile  nature of hormone release is essential for the maintenance of normal ovulatory menstrual cycles because constant infusion of GnRH results in cessation of gonadotropin release and ovarian steroid production (see Chapter 46). The neuropeptide kisspeptin 1, which is released from kisspeptin neurons located in the arcuate nucleus and elsewhere in the hypothalamus, regu­ lates GnRH pulsatility through its G protein-coupled receptor, GPR54, expressed in GnRH neurons (Figure 48–2). Estrogen reduces kisspeptin production in kisspeptin neurons within the acuate nucleus, while neu­ rokinin B through the neurokinin 3 receptor stimulates kisspeptin secre­ tion from the same kisspeptin neurons. Inactivating mutations in GPR54 have been associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (Seminara, 2006), as have inactivating mutations in the kisspeptin gene (Topaloglu et al., 2012). In contrast, activating mutations of the kisspeptin gene can lead to central precocious puberty (Silveira et al., 2010). Finally, muta­ tions in neurokinin B or its receptor have also been associated with pubertal failure (Topaloglu et al., 2009). Although the precise mechanism that regulates the timing of GnRH release (i.e., pulse frequency) is unclear, hypothalamic cells appear to D E E opioid dopamine GABA A B C D E E TIME (h) Neuronal Activity (discharges per min) LH (ng/mL) hypothalamic pulse generator uterus ovary estrogen progesterone estrogen progesterone gonadotrope GnRH NE progesterone + ++ + + + + – + + – – GnRH neuron pituitary portal vasculature pituitary medial basal hypothalamus arcuate nucleus estrogen progesterone 1 2 3 4 0 GnRH opioid dopamine GABA LH / FSH NKB NK3R KNDY neuron Kisspeptin Figure 48–2 Neuroendocrine control of gonadotropin secretion in females.  The hypothalamic pulse generator located in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus functions as a neuronal “clock” that fires at regular hourly intervals ( A ). This results in the periodic release of GnRH from GnRH-containing neurons into the hypothalamic-pituitary portal vasculature ( B ). GnRH neurons ( B ) receive inhibitory input from opioid, dopamine, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurons and stimulatory input from noradrenergic neurons. The pulses of GnRH trigger the intermittent release of LH and FSH from pituitary gonadotropes ( C ), resulting in the pulsatile plasma profile ( D ). FSH and LH regulate ovarian production of estrogen and progesterone, which exert feedback controls ( E ). (See text and Figure 48–3 for additional details.) 963 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY have an intrinsic ability to release GnRH episodically. The overall pat­ tern of GnRH release likely is regulated by the interplay of intrinsic mechanism(s) and extrinsic synaptic inputs from opioid, catecholamine, GABAergic, and kisspeptin neurons (Figure 48–2). Ovarian steroids, primarily progesterone, regulate the frequency of GnRH release, but the cellular and molecular mechanisms of this regulation are not well established. At puberty , the pulse generator is activated and establishes cyclic pro­ files of pituitary and ovarian hormones. Although the mechanism of acti­ vation is not entirely established, it may involve increases in circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and leptin levels, the latter acting to inhibit neuropeptide Y in the arcuate nucleus to relieve an inhibitory effect on GnRH neurons. Figure 48–3 provides a schematic diagram of the profiles of gonado­ tropin and gonadal steroid levels in the menstrual cycle. The “average” plasma levels of LH throughout the cycle are shown in panel A of Figure 48–3; insets illustrate the pulsatile patterns of LH during the pro­ liferative and secretory phases in more detail. The average LH levels are similar throughout the early (follicular) and late (luteal) phases of the cycle, but the frequency and amplitude of the LH pulses are quite dif­ ferent in the two phases. This characteristic pattern of hormone secre­ tions results from complex positive- and negative-feedback mechanisms (Hotchkiss and Knobil, 1994). In the early follicular phase  of the cycle, (1) the pulse generator pro­ duces bursts of neuronal activity with a frequency of about one per hour that correspond with pulses of GnRH secretion; (2) these cause a corre­ sponding pulsatile release of LH and FSH from pituitary gonadotropes; and (3) FSH in particular causes the graafian follicle to mature and secrete estrogen. The effects of estrogens on the pituitary are inhibitory at this — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[60] and wild yams, are available as unapproved marketed nonprescription items and often are touted as providing benefits similar to those from compounds with established estrogenic activity. These products may contain flavonoids such as genistein (Table 48–1) that display estrogenic activity in laboratory tests, albeit generally much less than that of estra­ diol. In theory, these preparations could produce appreciable estrogenic effects, but their efficacy at relevant doses has not been established in human trials (Fitzpatrick, 2003). Administration of estradiol via transdermal patches provides slow, sustained release of the hormone, systemic distribution, and more con­ stant blood levels than oral dosing. Estradiol is also available as a topi­ cal emulsion applied to the upper thigh and calf or as a gel applied once daily to the arm. The transdermal route does not lead to the high levels of the drug that occur in the portal circulation after oral administra­ tion, and it is thus expected to minimize hepatic effects of estrogens A B C E ER SRC-1 HDAC1 GGTCAnnnTGACC GGTCAnnnTGACC GGTCAnnnTGACC p300 GTA TRAP Agonist Antagonist E T T E E T T ER ER ER ER ER E NCoR SWI/SNF ER TATAA GGTCAnnnTGACC Figure 48–4 Molecular mechanism of action of nuclear ER.  A.  Unliganded ER exists as a monomer within the nucleus.  B.  Agonists such as 17β-estradiol (E) bind to the ER and cause a ligand-directed change in conformation that facilitates dimerization and interaction with specific ERE sequences in DNA. The ER-DNA complex recruits coactivators such as SWI/SNF that modify chromatin structure and coactivators such as SRC-1, which has histone acetyltransferase activity that further alters chromatin structure. This remodeling facilitates the exchange of the recruited proteins such that other coactivators (e.g., p300 and the TRAP complex) associate on the target gene promoter and proteins that comprise the general transcription apparatus (GTA) are recruited, with subsequent synthesis of mRNA.  C.  Antagonists such as tamoxifen (T) also bind to the ER but produce a different receptor conformation. The antagonist-induced conformation also facilitates dimerization and interaction with DNA, but a different set of proteins called corepressors, such as nuclear hormone receptor corepressor (NcoR), are recruited to the complex. NcoR further recruits proteins such as histone deacetylase I (HDAC1) that act on histones to stabilize nucleosome structure and prevent interaction with the GTA. 967 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY (e.g., effects on hepatic protein synthesis, lipoprotein profiles, and tri­ glyceride levels). When dissolved in oil and injected, esters of estradiol are well absorbed. Preparations available for intramuscular injection include estradiol valerate  or  estradiol cypionate  and may be absorbed over several weeks following a single intramuscular injection. Preparations of estradiol or conjugated estrogen creams are available for topical administration to the vagina. These are effective locally, but systemic effects also are possible due to significant absorption. A 3-month vaginal ring may be used for slow release of estradiol, and tablets are also available for vaginal use ( Vagifem  and generics). Estradiol, ethinyl estradiol, and other estrogens are extensively bound to plasma proteins. Estradiol and other naturally occurring estrogens are bound mainly to SHBG and to a lesser degree to serum albumin. In contrast, ethinyl estradiol is bound extensively to serum albumin but not SHBG. Due to their size and lipophilic nature, unbound estrogens dis­ tribute rapidly and extensively. Variations in estradiol metabolism occur and depend on the stage of the menstrual cycle, menopausal status, and several genetic polymor­ phisms (Herrington and Klein, 2001). In general, the hormone undergoes rapid hepatic biotransformation, with a plasma  t 1/2  measured in minutes. Estradiol is converted primarily by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to estrone, which undergoes conversion by 16α-hydroxylation and 17-keto reduction to estriol, the major urinary metabolite. A variety of sulfate and glucuronide conjugates also are excreted in the urine. Lesser amounts of estrone or estradiol are oxidized to the 2-hydroxycatechols by CYP3A4 in the liver and by CYP1A in extrahepatic tissues or to 4-hydroxycatechols by CYP1B1 in extrahepatic sites, with the 2-hydroxycatechol formed to a greater extent. The 2- and 4-hydroxycatechols are largely inactivated by catechol- O -methyl transferases. However, smaller amounts may be con­ verted by CYP- or peroxidase-catalyzed reactions to yield semiquinones or quinones that are capable of forming DNA adducts or of generating (via redox cycling) reactive oxygen species (ROSs) that could oxidize DNA bases (Yue et al., 2003). Estrogens also undergo enterohepatic recirculation via (1) sulfate and glucuronide conjugation in the liver, (2) biliary secretion of the conju­ gates into the intestine, and (3) hydrolysis in the gut (largely by bacterial enzymes) followed by reabsorption. Many other drugs and environmental agents (e.g., cigarette smoke) act as inducers or inhibitors of the various enzymes that metabolize estrogens and thus have the potential to alter their clearance. Consid­ eration of the impact of these factors on efficacy and untoward effects is increasingly important with the decreased doses of estrogens cur­ rently employed for both menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) and contraception. Ethinyl estradiol is cleared much more slowly than estradiol due to decreased hepatic metabolism, and the elimination-phase  t 1/2  in various studies ranges from 13 to 27 h. Unlike estradiol, the primary route of biotransformation of ethinyl estradiol is via 2-hydroxylation and subse­ quent formation of the corresponding 2- and 3-methyl ethers.  Mestranol , another semisynthetic estrogen and a component of some combination oral contraceptives, is the 3-methyl ether of ethinyl estradiol. In the body, it undergoes rapid hepatic demethylation to ethinyl estradiol, which is its active form (Fotherby, 1996). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Antiestrogens By altering the conformation of the two different ERs and thereby changing interactions with coactivators and corepressors in cell-specific and promoter-specific contexts, ligands may have a broad spectrum of activities from purely antiestrogenic in all tissues, to partially estrogenic in some tissues with antiestrogenic or no activities in others, to purely estrogenic activities in all tissues. The elucidation of these concepts has been a major breakthrough in estrogen pharmacology and should permit the rational design of drugs with selective patterns of estrogenic activity (Smith and O’Malley, 2004). Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators: Tamoxifen, Raloxifene, and Toremifene Selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs, are compounds with tissue-selective actions. The pharmacological goal of these drugs is to — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[61] ciliated epithelial cells that line the fallopian tubes to in­ crease. Also, activity of the cilia is considerably enhanced. These cilia always beat toward the uterus, which helps propel the fertilized ovum in that direction. Effect of Estrogens on the Breasts.  The primordial breasts of females and males are exactly alike. In fact, un­ der the influence of appropriate hormones, the masculine breast during the first 2 decades of life can develop suffi­ ciently to produce milk in the same manner as the female breast. Estrogens cause (1) development of the stromal tissues of the breasts, (2) growth of an extensive ductile system, and (3) deposition of fat in the breasts. The lobules and alveoli of the breast develop to a slight extent under the influence of estrogens alone, but it is progesterone and prolactin that ultimately complete the growth and func­ tion of these structures. In summary, the estrogens initiate growth of the breasts and of the milk-­producing apparatus. They are also responsible for the characteristic growth and external appearance of the mature female breast. However, they do not complete the job of converting the breasts into milk-­ producing organs. Effect of Estrogens on the Skeleton.  Estrogens inhibit osteoclastic activity in the bones and therefore stimulate bone growth. As discussed in  Chapter 80 , at least part of this effect is due to stimulation of  osteoprotegerin,  which is also called  osteoclastogenesis inhibitory factor,  a cytokine that inhibits bone resorption. At puberty, when the female enters her reproduc­ tive years, her growth in height becomes rapid for sev­ eral years. However, estrogens also cause uniting of the epiphyses with the shafts of the long bones. This effect of estrogen in the female is much stronger than the similar effect of testosterone in the male. As a result, growth of the female usually ceases several years earlier than growth of the male. A female eunuch who is devoid of estrogen production usually grows several inches taller than a nor­ mal mature female because her epiphyses do not unite at the normal time. Osteoporosis of the Bones Caused by Estrogen De­ ficiency in Old Age.  After menopause, almost no estro­ gens are secreted by the ovaries. This estrogen deficiency leads to (1) increased osteoclastic activity in the bones, (2) decreased bone matrix, and (3) decreased deposition of bone calcium and phosphate. In some women this ef­ fect is extremely severe, and the resulting condition is called  osteoporosis,  described in  Chapter 80 . Because osteoporosis can greatly weaken the bones and lead to bone fracture, especially fracture of the vertebrae, many postmenopausal women are treated prophylactically with estrogen replacement to prevent the osteoporotic effects. Estrogens Slightly Increase Protein Deposition.  Estro­ gens cause a slight increase in total body protein, which is ev­ idenced by a slight positive nitrogen balance when estrogens are administered. This effect mainly results from the growth-­ promoting effect of estrogen on the sexual organs, the bones, and a few other tissues of the body. The enhanced protein deposition caused by testosterone is much more general and much more powerful than that caused by estrogens. Estrogens Increase Body Metabolism and Fat Deposi­ tion.  Estrogens increase the whole-­body metabolic rate slightly, but only about one-third as much as the increase caused by testosterone. Estrogens also cause deposition of increased quantities of fat in the subcutaneous tissues. As a result, the percentage of body fat in females is con­ siderably greater than that in the males whose bodies con­ tain more protein. In addition to deposition of fat in the breasts and subcutaneous tissues, estrogens cause deposi­ tion of fat in the buttocks and thighs, which is characteris­ tic of the feminine figure. Estrogens Have Little Effect on Hair Distribution.  Es­ trogens do not greatly affect hair distribution. However, hair does develop in the pubic region and in the axillae after puberty. Androgens formed in increased quantities by the female adrenal glands after puberty are mainly re­ sponsible for this development of hair. Effect of Estrogens on the Skin.  Estrogens cause the skin to develop a texture that is soft and usually smooth, but even so, the skin of a woman is thicker than that of a child or a castrated female. Estrogens also cause the skin to become more vascular, which is often associated with increased warmth of the skin and greater bleeding of cut surfaces than is observed in men. Effect of Estrogens on Electrolyte Balance.  The chemi­ cal similarity of estrogenic hormones to adrenocortical hormones has been discussed previously. Estrogens, like aldosterone and some other adrenocortical hormones, cause sodium and water retention by the kidney tubules. This effect of estrogens is normally slight and rarely of sig­ nificance, but during pregnancy the tremendous forma­ tion of estrogens by the placenta may contribute to body fluid retention, as discussed in  Chapter 83 . FUNCTIONS OF PROGESTERONE Progesterone Promotes Secretory Changes in the Uterus.  A major function of progesterone is  to promote secretory changes in the uterine endometrium  during the latter half of the monthly female sexual cycle, thus pre­ paring the uterus for implantation of the fertilized ovum. UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 1036 This function is discussed later in connection with the en­ dometrial cycle of the uterus. In addition to this effect on the endometrium, proges­ terone decreases the frequency and intensity of uterine contractions, thereby helping to prevent expulsion of the implanted ovum. Progesterone Promotes Secretion by the Fallopian Tubes.  Progesterone also promotes increased secretion by the mucosal lining of the fallopian tubes. These secre­ tions are necessary for nutrition of the fertilized, dividing ovum as it traverses the fallopian tube before implanta­ tion. Progesterone Promotes Development of the Breasts. Progesterone promotes development of the lobules and alveoli of the breasts, causing the alveolar cells to pro­ liferate, enlarge, and become secretory. However, pro­ gesterone does not cause the alveoli to secrete milk; as discussed in  Chapter 83 , milk is secreted only after the prepared breast is further stimulated by  prolactin  from the anterior pituitary gland. Progesterone also causes the breasts to swell. Part of this swelling is due to the secretory development in the — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 82 - Female Physiology Before Pregnancy and Female Hormones, Functions of Progesterone, Halaman 981, 982
[62] secretion of FSH and, to a lesser extent, LH by the ante­ rior pituitary gland. Therefore, inhibin may be especially important in causing the decrease in secretion of FSH and LH at the end of the monthly female sexual cycle. POSITIVE FEEDBACK EFFECT OF ESTROGEN BEFORE OVULATION—THE PREOVULATORY LUTEINIZING HORMONE SURGE The anterior pituitary gland secretes greatly increased amounts of LH for 1 to 2 days beginning 24 to 48 hours Figure 82-­10.   Shown is a pulsatile change in luteinizing hormone (LH) in the peripheral circulation of a pentobarbital-­ anesthetized ovariectomized rhesus mon­ key  (red line)  and a minute by minute recording of  multi-­unit electrical activity (MUA) in the mediobasal hypothalamus (blue line).

This effect is demonstrated in  Figure 82-­4 . The figure shows a much smaller preovulatory surge of FSH as well. Experiments have shown that estrogen infusion into a female above a critical rate for 2 to 3 days during the latter part of the first half of the ovarian cycle will cause rap­ idly accelerating growth of the ovarian follicles, as well as rapidly accelerating secretion of ovarian estrogens. Dur­ ing this period, secretions of FSH and LH by the anterior pituitary gland are at first slightly suppressed. Secretion of LH then increases abruptly 6-­fold to 8-­fold, and secretion of FSH increases about 2-­fold. The greatly increased LH secretion causes ovulation to occur. The cause of this abrupt surge in LH secretion is not known. However, the following explanations are possible: 1.	 It has been suggested that at this point in the cycle, estrogen has a peculiar  positive feedback effect  of stimulating pituitary secretion of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH (see  Figure 82-­11 ), which is in sharp contrast to the normal negative feedback effect of estrogen that occurs during the remainder of the fe­ male monthly cycle. 2.	 The granulosa cells of the follicles begin to secrete small but increasing quantities of progesterone a day or so before the preovulatory LH surge, and it has been suggested that this secretion might be the factor that stimulates the excess LH secretion. Without this normal preovulatory surge of LH, ovula­ tion will not occur. FEEDBACK OSCILLATION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC-­PITUITARY-­OVARIAN SYSTEM Now that we have discussed the interrelations of the dif­ ferent components of the female hormonal system, we can explain the feedback oscillation that controls the rhythm of the female sexual cycle. It seems to operate in approximately the following sequence of three events. 1.	  Postovulatory secretion of the ovarian hormones and depression of the pituitary gonadotropins.  Be­ tween ovulation and the beginning of menstrua­ tion, the corpus luteum secretes large quantities of progesterone and estrogen, as well as inhibin. All these hormones together have a combined negative feedback effect on the anterior pituitary gland and hypothalamus, causing suppression of FSH and LH secretion and decreasing them to their lowest levels about 3 to 4 days before the onset of menstruation. These effects are shown in  Figure 82-­4 . 2.	  Follicular growth phase.  Two to 3 days before men­ struation, the corpus luteum has regressed to al­ most total involution and secretion of estrogen, progesterone, and inhibin from the corpus luteum decreases to a low ebb, which releases the hypo­ thalamus and anterior pituitary from the negative feedback effect of these hormones. Therefore, a day or so later, at about the time that menstrua­ tion begins, pituitary secretion of FSH begins to increase again, as much as 2-­fold; then, several days after menstruation begins, LH secretion increases slightly as well. These hormones initiate new ovar­ ian follicle growth and a progressive increase in the secretion of estrogen, reaching a peak estrogen Androgens Target tissues Progestins Estrogens FSH CNS GnRH Anterior pituitary Inhibin Activin LH Granulosa cell Theca cell Ovary Behavioral effects Hypothalamus Figure 82-­11.   Feedback regulation of the hypothalamic-­pituitary-­ ovarian axis in females.

UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 1040 secretion at about 12.5 to 13 days after the onset of the new female monthly sexual cycle. During the first 11 to 12 days of this follicle growth, the rates of pituitary secretion of the gonadotropins FSH and LH decrease slightly because of the negative feed­ back effect, mainly of estrogen, on the anterior pitu­ itary gland. Then there is a sudden, marked increase in the secretion of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH. This increased secretion is the preovulatory surge of LH and FSH, which is followed by ovulation. 3.	  The preovulatory surge of LH and FSH causes ovu­ lation.  About 11.5 to 12 days after the onset of the monthly cycle, the decline in FSH and LH secretion comes to an abrupt halt. The high level of estrogens at this time (or the beginning of progesterone se­ cretion by the follicles) is believed to cause a posi­ tive feedback stimulatory effect on the anterior pi­ tuitary, as explained earlier, which leads to a large surge in the secretion of LH and, to a lesser extent, FSH. Whatever the cause of this preovulatory LH and FSH surge, the great excess of LH leads to both ovulation and subsequent development of and se­ cretion by the corpus luteum. Thus, the hormonal system begins its new round of secretions until the next instance of ovulation.

[63] of the receptors has increased. Hormones may down- regulate or up-regulate their own receptors in target tissues and even may regulate receptors for other hormones. Down-Regulation Down-regulation is a mechanism in which a hormone decreases  the number or affinity of its receptors in a target tissue. Down-regulation may occur by decreasing the synthesis of new receptors, by increasing the deg- radation of existing receptors, or by inactivating recep- tors. The purpose of down-regulation is to reduce the sensitivity of the target tissue when hormone levels are high for an extended period of time. As down-regulation occurs, the response to hormone declines, although hormone levels remain high. An example of down- regulation is the effect of  progesterone  on its own receptor in the uterus (see Chapter 10). Down-regulation can also refer to a hormone’s effect on receptors for other related hormones. This type of down-regulation also is illustrated by progesterone. In the uterus, progesterone down-regulates its own recep- tor  and  down-regulates the receptors for estrogen. A second example of this type of down-regulation is seen in the thyroid system: Triiodothyronine, or  T 3 ,  decreases the sensitivity of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) receptors in the anterior pituitary. The overall effect is that chronically high levels of T 3  reduce the overall responsiveness of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. Up-Regulation Up-regulation of receptors is a mechanism in which a hormone  increases  the number or affinity of its receptors. Up-regulation may occur by increasing syn- thesis of new receptors, decreasing degradation of existing receptors, or activating receptors. For example, prolactin  increases the number of its receptors in the breast,  growth hormone  increases the number of its receptors in skeletal muscle and liver, and  estrogen increases the number of its receptors in the uterus. A hormone also can up-regulate the receptors for other hormones. For example, estrogen not only up- regulates its own receptor in the uterus, but it also up-regulates the receptors for LH in the ovaries. 402    •    Physiology At the molecular level, G proteins are heterotrimeric proteins (i.e., they have three subunits). The three subunits are designated alpha ( α ), beta ( β ), and gamma ( γ ). The  α  subunit can bind either guanosine diphos- phate (GDP) or GTP, and it contains GTPase activity. When GDP is bound to the  α  subunit, the G protein is inactive; when GTP is bound, the G protein is active and can perform its coupling function. Guanosine nucleotide-releasing factors (GRFs) facilitate dissocia- tion of GDP so that GTP binds more rapidly, whereas GTPase-activating factors (GAPs) facilitate hydrolysis of GTP. Thus the relative activity of GRFs and GAPs influ- ences the overall rate of G protein activation. G proteins can be either stimulatory or inhibitory and are called, accordingly,  G s  or  G i .  Stimulatory or inhibitory activity resides in the  α  subunit ( α s  or  α i ). Thus when GTP is bound to the  α s  subunit of a G s protein, the G s  protein  stimulates  the effector enzyme (e.g., adenylyl cyclase). When GTP is bound to the  α i subunit of a G i  protein, the G i  protein  inhibits  the effector enzyme. Adenylyl Cyclase Mechanism The adenylyl cyclase/cAMP mechanism is utilized by many hormonal systems (see  Table 9.3 ). This mecha- nism involves binding of a hormone to a receptor, coupling by a G s  or G i  protein, and then activation or inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, leading to increases or decreases in intracellular cAMP. cAMP, the second messenger, then amplifies the hormonal signal to produce the final physiologic actions. The steps in the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP mechanism are shown in  Figure 9.4 . In this example, the hormone utilizes a G s  protein (rather than a G i  protein). The receptor–G s –adenylyl cyclase complex is embedded in the cell membrane. When no hormone is bound to the MECHANISMS OF HORMONE ACTION AND SECOND MESSENGERS Hormone actions on target cells begin when the hormone binds to a membrane receptor, forming a hormone-receptor complex. In many hormonal systems, the hormone-receptor complex is coupled to effector proteins by guanosine triphosphate (GTP)–binding proteins (G proteins). The effector proteins usually are enzymes, either adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C. When the effector proteins are activated, a second messenger, either cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP 3 ), is produced, which amplifies the original hormonal signal and orchestrates the physiologic actions. The major mechanisms of hormone action on target cells are the  adenylyl cyclase  mechanism, in which cAMP is the second messenger; the  phospholipase C mechanism, in which IP 3 /Ca 2 +  is the second messenger; and the  steroid hormone  mechanism. In addition, insulin and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) act on their target cells through a  tyrosine kinase  mechanism. Finally, several hormones activate  guanylate cyclase, in which cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cyclic GMP, or cGMP) is the second messenger. The mechanisms of action of the major hormones are summarized in Table 9.3 . G Proteins G proteins are discussed in Chapter 2 in the context of autonomic receptors. Briefly, G proteins are a family of membrane-bound proteins that couple hormone recep- tors to effector enzymes (e.g., adenylyl cyclase). Thus G proteins serve as “molecular switches” that decide whether the hormone action can proceed.

[64] the plasma becomes steady. At this time, the disappear- ance rate of the radioactive hormone from the plasma equals the rate at which it is infused, which gives one the rate of disappearance. At the same time, the plasma concentration of the radioactive hormone is measured using a standard radioactive counting procedure. Then, using the formula just cited, the metabolic clearance rate is calculated. Hormones are “cleared” from the plasma in several ways, including (1) metabolic destruction by the tissues, (2) binding with the tissues, (3) excretion by the liver into the bile, and (4) excretion by the kidneys into the urine. For certain hormones, a decreased metabolic clearance rate may cause an excessively high concentration of the hormone in the circulating body fluids. For example, excessive steroid hormones accumulate when the liver is diseased because these hormones are conjugated mainly in the liver and then “cleared” into the bile. Hormones are sometimes degraded at their target cells by enzymatic processes that cause endocytosis of the cell membrane hormone-­receptor complex; the hormone is then metabolized in the cell, and the receptors are usually recycled back to the cell membrane. Most of the peptide hormones and catecholamines are water soluble and circulate freely in the blood. They are usually degraded by enzymes in the blood and tissues and rapidly excreted by the kidneys and liver, thus remaining in the blood for only a short time. For example, the half-­ life of angiotensin II circulating in the blood is less than a minute. Hormones that are bound to plasma proteins are cleared from the blood at much slower rates and may remain in the circulation for several hours or even days. The half-­life of adrenal steroids in the circulation, for example, ranges between 20 and 100 minutes, whereas the half-­life of the protein-­bound thyroid hormones may be as long as 1 to 6 days. MECHANISMS OF ACTION OF HORMONES HORMONE RECEPTORS AND THEIR ACTIVATION The first step of a hormone’s action is to bind to specific receptors  at the target cell. Cells that lack receptors for the hormones do not respond. Receptors for some hormones are located on the target cell membrane, whereas other hormone receptors are located in the cytoplasm or the nucleus. When the hormone combines with its receptor, this action usually initiates a cascade of reactions in the cell, with each stage becoming more powerfully activated so that even small concentrations of the hormone can have a large effect. Hormone receptors are large proteins, and each cell that is to be stimulated usually has some 2000 to 100,000 receptors. Also, each receptor is usually highly specific for a single hormone, which determines the type of hormone that will act on a particular tissue. The target tissues that are affected by a hormone are those that contain its spe- cific receptors. The locations for the different types of hormone recep- tors are generally the following: 1.	  In or on the surface of the cell membrane.  The mem- brane receptors are specific mostly for the protein, peptide, and catecholamine hormones. 2.	  In the cell cytoplasm.  The primary receptors for the different steroid hormones are found mainly in the cytoplasm. 3.	  In the cell nucleus.  The receptors for the thyroid hormones are found in the nucleus and are believed to be located in direct association with one or more of the chromosomes. Chapter 75   Introduction to Endocrinology 921 U N I T  X I V The Number and Sensitivity of Hormone Receptors Are Regulated.  The number of receptors in a target cell usually does not remain constant from day to day or even from minute to minute. Receptor proteins are often inac- tivated or destroyed during the course of their function, and at other times they are reactivated or new ones are manufactured by the cell. For example, increased hor- mone concentration and increased binding with its target cell receptors sometimes cause the number of active re- ceptors to decrease. This  down-­regulation  of the recep- tors can occur as a result of (1) inactivation of some of the receptor molecules; (2) inactivation of some of the intracellular protein signaling molecules; (3) temporary sequestration of the receptor to the inside of the cell, away from the site of action of hormones that interact with cell membrane receptors; (4) destruction of the receptors by lysosomes after they are internalized; or (5) decreased production of the receptors. In each case, receptor down-­ regulation decreases the target tissue’s responsiveness to the hormone. Some hormones cause  up-­regulation  of receptors and intracellular signaling proteins; that is, the stimulat- ing hormone induces greater than normal formation of receptor or intracellular signaling molecules by the target cell or greater availability of the receptor for interaction with the hormone. When up-­regulation occurs, the target tissue becomes progressively more sensitive to the stimu- lating effects of the hormone. INTRACELLULAR SIGNALING AFTER HORMONE RECEPTOR ACTIVATION Almost without exception, a hormone affects its target tissues by first forming a hormone-­receptor complex. For- mation of this complex alters the function of the receptor, and the activated receptor initiates the hormonal effects. To explain this process, let us give a few examples of the different types of interactions. Ion Channel–Linked Receptors.  Virtually all the neu- rotransmitter substances, such as acetylcholine and nor- epinephrine, combine with receptors in the postsynap- tic membrane. This combination almost always causes a change in the structure of the receptor, usually opening or closing a channel for one or more ions. Some of these  ion channel–linked receptors  open (or close) channels for so- dium ions, others for potassium ions, others for calcium ions, and so forth. The altered movement of these ions through the channels causes the subsequent effects on the postsynaptic cells. Although a few hormones may exert some of their actions through activation of ion channel receptors, most hormones that open or close ions chan- nels do this indirectly by coupling with G protein–linked or enzyme-­linked receptors, as discussed next. G Protein–Linked Hormone Receptors.  Many hor- mones activate receptors that indirectly regulate the ac- tivity of target proteins (e.g., enzymes or ion channels) by — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 75 - Introduction to Endocrinology, Feedback Control of Hormone Secretion, Halaman 872, 871

They constitute about 20% of the anterior pituitary cells. Besides ACTH, corticotrophs also release melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH) and lipotropin. While synthetic derivatives of ACTH are used commonly in the diagnostic assessment of adrenal cortex function, synthetic corticosteroids, rather than ACTH, are used therapeutically. The adrenal cortex synthesizes and secretes steroid hormones essential for adaptive responses to stress (glucocorticoid) and min­ eral balance (mineralocorticoid) and for some direct and indirect androgenic functions, particularly in women (adrenal androgens). Glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids are collectively referred as corticosteroids, with cortisol and aldosterone being the main physi­ ologic forms. Corticosteroids and their biologically active synthetic derivatives may differ individually in their glucocorticoid (metabolic/ anti-inflammatory) and mineralocorticoid (electrolyte-regulating) actions. These agents are used as physiological replacement therapy when endogenous production is impaired, as in adrenal insufficiency. The broad anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties of glucocorticoids are of great therapeutic value in numerous conditions where suppression of inflammation is needed (such as autoimmune dis­ eases and allergic reactions), making them among the most frequently pre­ scribed classes of drugs. Shortly after synthetic  cortisone  became available, Hench and colleagues demonstrated its dramatic effect in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, setting the stage for the clinical use of corticosteroids in a wide variety of diseases, as discussed in this chapter. Because gluco­ corticoids exert effects on almost every organ system, their administration and withdrawal may be complicated by severe side effects. Therefore, the decision to institute therapy with systemic glucocorticoids always requires careful consideration of the relative risks and benefits in each patient. Corticotropin (ACTH) Human ACTH, a peptide containing 39 amino acids, is synthesized as part of a larger precursor protein, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC). In the pituitary, POMC undergoes proteolytic cleavage at dibasic residues by two serine endoproteases, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 1/3 and 2 (PCSK1/3 and 2; Figure 50–1). This process produces ACTH as well as 50 Chapter Adrenocorticotropic Hormone, Adrenal Steroids, and the Adrenal Cortex Christopher J. Hupfeld and Jorge A.

A few years later, Brown-Séquard demonstrated that bilateral adrenalectomy was fatal in laboratory animals. It became clear that the adrenal cortex, rather than the medulla, was essential for survival in these ablation experiments and that the cortex reg­ ulated carbohydrate metabolism and fluid and electrolyte balance. The isolation and identification of the adrenal steroids by Reich­ stein and Kendall and the effects of these compounds on carbohy­ drate metabolism (hence the term glucocorticoids) culminated with the synthesis of  cortisone , the readily available, pharmacologically effective glucocorticoid. Subsequently, Tait and colleagues isolated and characterized aldosterone, which potently affected fluid and electrolyte balance and was termed a mineralocorticoid.

[66] similar throughout the early (follicular) and late (luteal) phases of the cycle, but the frequency and amplitude of the LH pulses are quite dif­ ferent in the two phases. This characteristic pattern of hormone secre­ tions results from complex positive- and negative-feedback mechanisms (Hotchkiss and Knobil, 1994). In the early follicular phase  of the cycle, (1) the pulse generator pro­ duces bursts of neuronal activity with a frequency of about one per hour that correspond with pulses of GnRH secretion; (2) these cause a corre­ sponding pulsatile release of LH and FSH from pituitary gonadotropes; and (3) FSH in particular causes the graafian follicle to mature and secrete estrogen.

Major regulatory effects of ovarian steroids on hypothalamic-pituitary function. Estrogen decreases the amount of FSH and LH released (i.e., gonad­ otropin pulse amplitude) during most of the cycle and triggers a surge of LH release only at midcycle. Progesterone decreases the frequency of GnRH release from the hypothalamus and thus decreases the frequency of plasma gonadotropin pulses. Progesterone also increases the amount of LH released (i.e., the pulse amplitude) during the luteal phase of the cycle. https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 964 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT decline (i.e., the amplitude of the LH pulse decreases), so gonadotropin levels gradually fall (Figure 48–3).  Inhibin,  produced by the ovary, exerts negative feedback to selectively decrease serum FSH (see Chapter 46). Activin and follistatin, two other peptides released from the ovary, may also regulate FSH production and secretion to a lesser extent, although their levels do not vary appreciably during the menstrual cycle. At midcycle , serum estradiol rises above a threshold level of 150 to 200 pg/mL for about 36 h. This sustained elevation of estrogen no longer inhibits gonadotropin release but exerts a brief positive-feedback effect on the pituitary to trigger the preovulatory surge of LH and FSH. This effect involves both a yet uncharacterized estrogen-induced rise in kisspeptin and a change in pituitary responsiveness to GnRH. The midcycle surge in gonadotropins stimulates follicular rupture and ovulation within 1 to 2 days. The ruptured follicle then develops into the corpus luteum, which produces large amounts of progesterone and lesser amounts of estrogen under the influence of LH during the second half of the cycle. In the absence of pregnancy, the corpus luteum ceases to func­ tion, steroid levels drop, and menstruation occurs. When steroid levels drop, the pulse generator reverts to a firing pattern characteristic of the fol­ licular phase, the entire system then resets, and a new ovarian cycle occurs. Regulation of the frequency and amplitude of gonadotropin secretions by steroids may be summarized as follows: Estrogens act primarily on the pituitary to control the amplitude of gonadotropin pulses, and they may also contribute to the amplitude of GnRH pulses secreted by the hypothalamus. In the follicular phase  of the cycle, estrogens inhibit gonadotropin release but then have a brief midcycle stimulatory action that increases the amount released and causes the LH surge. Progesterone, acting on the hypothalamus, exerts the predominant control of the frequency of LH release. It decreases the firing rate of the hypothalamic pulse generator, an action thought to be mediated largely via inhibitory opioid neurons (con­ taining PRs) that synapse with GnRH neurons. Progesterone also exerts a direct effect on the pituitary to oppose the inhibitory actions of estro­ gens and thus enhance the amount of LH released (i.e., to increase the amplitude of the LH pulses). These steroid feedback effects, coupled with the intrinsic activity of the hypothalamic GnRH pulse generator, lead to relatively frequent LH pulses of small amplitude in the follicular phase of the cycle and less-frequent pulses of larger amplitude in the luteal phase. Studies in knockout mice indicated that ERα (Hewitt and Korach, 2003) and PR-A (Conneely et al., 2002) mediate the major actions of estrogens and progestins, respectively, on the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. When the ovaries are removed or cease to function, there is overpro­ duction of FSH and LH, which are excreted in the urine. Measurement of urinary or plasma LH is valuable to assess pituitary function and the effectiveness of therapeutic doses of estrogen. Effects of Cyclical Gonadal Steroids on the Reproductive Tract The cyclical changes in estrogen and progesterone production by the ova­ ries regulate corresponding events in the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. Physiologically, these changes prepare the uterus for implan­ tation, and the proper timing of events in these tissues is essential for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the endometrium is shed as the menstrual discharge. The uterus is composed of an  endometrium  and a  myometrium . The endometrium contains an epithelium lining the uterine cavity and an underlying stroma; the myometrium is the smooth muscle component — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[67] specific enzyme system. A change in even a single enzyme in the schema can cause vastly different types and relative pro­ portions of hormones to be formed. For example, very large quantities of masculinizing sex hormones or other steroid compounds not normally present in the blood can occur with altered activity of only one of the enzymes in this pathway. The chemical formulas of aldosterone and cortisol, which are the major mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones, respectively, are shown in  Figure 78-­2 . Cortisol has a keto oxygen on carbon number 3 and is hydroxylated at carbon numbers 11 and 21. The mineralocorticoid aldos­ terone has an oxygen atom bound at the number 18 carbon. In addition to aldosterone and cortisol, other steroids having glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activities, or both, are normally secreted in small amounts by the adrenal cortex. Furthermore, several additional potent steroid hor­ mones not normally formed in the adrenal glands have been synthesized and are used in various forms of therapy. Some of the more important of the corticosteroid hormones, in­ cluding the synthetic ones, are the following, as summarized in  Table 78-­1 . Mineralocorticoids • Aldosterone (very potent; accounts for  ≈ 90% of all min­ eralocorticoid activity) • Deoxycorticosterone (1/30 as potent as aldosterone, but very small quantities are secreted) • Corticosterone (slight mineralocorticoid activity) • 9 α -­Fluorocortisol (synthetic; slightly more potent than aldosterone) • Cortisol (slight mineralocorticoid activity, but a large quantity is secreted) • Cortisone (slight mineralocorticoid activity) Glucocorticoids • Cortisol (very potent; accounts for  ≈ 95% of all glucocor­ ticoid activity) • Corticosterone (provides  ≈ 4% of total glucocorticoid ac­ tivity, but is much less potent than cortisol) • Cortisone (almost as potent as cortisol) • Prednisone (synthetic; four times as potent as cortisol) • Methylprednisone (synthetic; five times as potent as cor­ tisol) • Dexamethasone (synthetic; 30 times as potent as cortisol) It is clear from this list that some of these hormones and synthetic steroids have both glucocorticoid and miner­ alocorticoid activities. It is especially significant that corti­ sol normally has some mineralocorticoid activity, because some syndromes of excess cortisol secretion can cause significant mineralocorticoid effects, along with its much more potent glucocorticoid effects. The intense glucocorticoid activity of the synthetic hor­ mone dexamethasone, which has almost zero mineralocor­ ticoid activity, makes it an especially important drug for stimulating specific glucocorticoid activity. Chapter 78   Adrenocortical Hormones 957 U N I T  X I V Adrenocortical Hormones Are Bound to Plasma Pro­ teins .  Approximately 90% to 95% of the cortisol in plas­ ma binds to plasma proteins, especially a globulin called cortisol-­binding globulin  or  transcortin  and, to a lesser extent, to albumin. This high degree of binding to plasma proteins slows the elimination of cortisol from the plasma; therefore, cortisol has a relatively long half-­life of 60 to 90 minutes. Only about 60% of circulating aldosterone com­ bines with the plasma proteins, and about 40% is in the free form; as a result, aldosterone has a relatively short half-­ life of about 20 minutes. These hormones are transported throughout the extracellular fluid compartment in both the combined and free forms. Binding of adrenal steroids to the plasma proteins may serve as a reservoir to lessen rapid fluctuations in free hor­ mone concentrations, as would occur, for example, with cortisol during brief periods of stress and episodic secre­ tion of ACTH.

Adrenocortical Hormones Are Metabolized in the Liv­ er .  The adrenal steroids are degraded mainly in the liver and are conjugated especially to  glucuronic acid  and, to a lesser extent, to sulfates. These substances are inactive and do not have mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid activity. About 25% of these conjugates are excreted in the bile and then in the feces. The remaining conjugates formed by the liver enter the circulation but are not bound to plasma pro­ teins, are highly soluble in the plasma, and are therefore filtered readily by the kidneys and excreted in the urine. Diseases of the liver markedly depress the rate of inactiva­ tion of adrenocortical hormones, and kidney diseases re­ duce the excretion of the inactive conjugates. The normal concentration of aldosterone in blood is about 6 nanograms (6 billionths of a gram) per 100 millilit­ ers, and the average secretory rate is approximately 150  μ g/ day (0.15 mg/day). The blood concentration of aldosterone, however, depends greatly on several factors, including di­ etary intake of sodium and potassium. The concentration of cortisol in the blood averages 12 μ g/100 ml, and the secretory rate averages 15 to 20 mg/day. However, blood concentration and secretion rate of corti­ sol fluctuate throughout the day, rising in the early morning and declining in the evening, as discussed later.

[68] with variable expression. In susceptible hair follicles, dihydrotestoster­ one (DHT) binds to the androgen receptor, and the hormone-receptor complex activates the genes responsible for the gradual transformation of large terminal follicles into miniaturized vellus follicles. Treatment of androgenetic alopecia is aimed at reducing hair loss and maintaining existing hair (Varothai and Bergfeld, 2014). Minoxidil , originally developed as an antihypertensive agent, was noted to be associated with hypertrichosis in some patients.  Minoxi­ dil  enhances follicular size, resulting in thicker hair shafts, and stim­ ulates and prolongs the anagen phase of the hair cycle, resulting in longer and increased numbers of hair. Treatment must be continued or any drug-induced hair growth will be lost. Patients with increased sulfotransferase enzyme activity are most likely to respond to  minoxidil treatment; this may be a useful predictive test in the future (Roberts et al., 2014). Topical  minoxidil  is available as a 2% solution and a 5% solution or foam. Allergic and irritant contact dermatitis can occur, and care should be taken in applying the drug because hair growth may emerge in undesirable locations. This is reversible on stopping the drug. Patients should be instructed to wash their hands after applying minoxidil . Oral low-dose  minoxidil  (0.25 – 5 mg daily) has been used off label for androgenic alopecia with recommended dosages of 0.5 – 2.5 mg daily in females or 2.5 – 5 mg daily in males.  The most common side effect with oral low-dose  minoxidil  is hypertrichosis. Additional poten­ tial side effects include postural hypotension, lower extremity edema, tachycardia, and headache. Finasteride  inhibits the type II isozyme of 5α-reductase, the enzyme that converts testosterone to DHT (see Chapter 49) and that is found in hair follicles. Balding areas of the scalp are associated with increased DHT levels and smaller hair follicles than nonbalding areas. Orally administered  finasteride  (1 mg/day) variably increases hair growth in men over a 2-year period.  Finasteride  is approved for use only in men but has been used off label for female pattern hair loss (Varothai and Bergfeld, 2014).  Finasteride  use in women is limited by its teratogenic­ ity. Pregnant women should not be exposed to the drug because of the potential for inducing genital abnormalities in male fetuses. Adverse effects of  finasteride  include decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, ejaculation disorder, and decreased ejaculate volume. There have been postmarketing surveillance reports of persistent sexual dysfunction after stopping the medication. As with  minoxidil , new hair growth will be lost when  finasteride  is discontinued.  Dutasteride  (0.5 mg/day) is a com­ bined type I and type II isozyme 5α-reductase inhibitor that has similar or greater efficacy, but side effects may be more common (Varothai and Bergfeld, 2014). Spironolactone  is an aldosterone antagonist and K + -sparing diuretic; it also has antiandrogen activity. It is used off label for female pattern alopecia at dosages of 50 to 200 mg/day (Varothai and Bergfeld, 2014). Women of reproductive potential should not receive  spironolactone  with­ out reliable contraception because  spironolactone  can cause feminization of a male fetus. Other Agents Eflornithine  is an inhibitor of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) that is approved for the reduction of excessive and unwanted facial hair in women. ODC is the rate-limiting enzyme in the synthesis of polyamines, which are important in cellular migration, differentiation, and prolifer­ ation. Levels of ODC activity are higher in proliferating cells, such as in follicular matrix cells in anagen phase, and inhibiting ODC decreases hair 1499 SECTION IX SPECIAL SYSTEMS PHARMACOLOGY growth.  Eflornithine  13.9% cream is applied twice daily and is intended to be used along with the patient’s preferred hair removal method to slow hair regrowth. Bimatoprost  is a prostaglandin analogue approved for topical treatment of hypotrichosis of the eyelashes by increasing their growth, including length, thickness, and darkness. The prostaglandin-mediated increase in eyelash growth was serendipitously noted during the use of intraocular prostaglandin analogues for glaucoma. The proposed mechanism of eye­ lash growth is by an increase in the fraction of hairs in, and the duration of, the anagen phase. Increased pigmentation of the hairs is thought to occur due to stimulation of melanin production without an increase in the number of melanocytes. Importantly, brown pigmentation of the iris and eyelid skin may occur, and the increased iris pigmentation may be permanent. Treatment of Hyperpigmentation The agents discussed are most effective on hormonally or light-induced pigmentation within the epidermis. They have limited efficacy on postinflammatory pigmentation within the dermis. Sun protection or avoidance is a vital component of any treatment regimen (Sheth and Pandya, 2011). Hydroquinone  (1,4-dihydroxybenzene) decreases melanocyte pigment production by inhibiting tyrosinase, the initial enzyme in the melanin biosynthetic pathway. In addition, it causes degradation of melanosomes and destruction of melanocytes by production of reactive oxygen rad­ icals. Formulations containing 1.5% to 2%  hydroquinone  are available OTC; 3% to 4%  hydroquinone  formulations are available by prescription. Penetration enhancers and sunscreen ingredients are added to some formulations. A combination prescription product consisting of  hydro­ quinone  4%,  fluocinolone  0.01%, and  tretinoin  0.05% is available. Adverse effects may include dermatitis and ochronosis. Azelaic acid,  a dicarboxylic acid isolated from cultures of  Malassezia furfur,  inhibits tyrosinase activity but is less effective than  hydroquinone . Because it has mild comedolytic, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties, it also is often used in acne and papulopustular rosacea, espe­ cially in patients with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Mequinol  (4-hydroxyanisole) is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase. It was approved as a 2% prescription product in combination with 0.01% tretinoin  and  vitamin C  for skin lightening, but it is not currently com­ mercially available. Monobenzone  (monobenzyl ether of hydroquinone) causes  permanent depigmentation and should  not  be used for routine hormonally induced or postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. A 20% cream is approved for final depigmentation therapy of extensive vitiligo affecting at least more than 50% body surface area; it is rarely used and not currently commer­ cially available. Glycolic acid  is an α-hydroxy acid used in chemical peels for dis­ orders of pigmentation. It is thought to work by inhibiting tyrosinase in a pH-independent manner and to cause exfoliation by decreasing keratinocyte adhesion. Potential side effects are erythema, desquama­ tion, and postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.  Glycolic acid  peels — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[69] cortical carcinoma. Its cytolytic action is due to its metabolic conversion to a reactive acyl chloride by adrenal mitochondrial CYPs and subsequent reactivity with cellular proteins. It also inhibits CYP11A1, thereby reduc­ ing steroid synthesis. Initial doses range from 2 to 6 g/day administered orally in three to four divided doses. The maximal dose can be as high as 16 g/day, if tolerated. Its onset of action takes weeks to months, and GI disturbances and ataxia are its major toxicities. Primary adrenal insuf­ ficiency is an expected consequence, and glucocorticoid replacement is required, typically in higher than usual doses. See Chapter 70 for the structure of  mitotane  and additional details on its use. Glucocorticoid Receptor Antagonists Mifepristone Mifepristone , a progesterone receptor antagonist used to terminate early pregnancy (see Chapter 48), is also a high-affinity GR antagonist. This latter activity reduces cortisol effects, including loss of negative feedback, which causes increases in serum levels of ACTH, cortisol, 11-deoxycortisol, and adrenal androgens.  Mifepristone  is approved for control of hypergly­ cemia in adults secondary to endogenous Cushing syndrome who have type 2 diabetes. The usual dose is 300 mg once daily. It is used off-label as treatment of intractable Cushing syndrome. Side effects include hyper­ tension and hypokalemia due to action of deoxycortisol at the MR. Dose adjustments are made based on improvement in general symptoms such as fatigue and depression and reduction of cortisol-induced hyperglyce­ mia. The expected paradoxical rise in cortisol level, if coupled with symp­ tomatic response, can be an indication of drug activity. GR Antagonists/Modulators in Development Relacorilant  is an orally available, high-affinity, selective antagonist for the glucocorticoid receptor currently undergoing clinical trials as a treat­ ment for endogenous Cushing syndrome and adrenocortical carcinoma. Unlike  mifepristone , it does not have appreciable affinity at the progester­ one receptor and is thus expected to be devoid of antiprogesterone effects. Miricorilant  is a high-affinity GR antagonist/modulator with significant MR antagonist activity. It is in development for nonalcoholic steatohepa­ titis and for antipsychotic-induced weight gain. Mineralocorticoid Receptor Antagonists MR antagonists have multiple therapeutic applications, and third- generation, highly selective, nonsteroidal agents are in advanced clinical development or approved in other countries. These drugs are covered in detail in Chapter 29.

[70] Six major hormones are secreted by the anterior lobe of the pituitary: TSH, FSH, LH, ACTH, growth hormone, and prolactin. Each hormone is secreted by a different cell type (except FSH and LH, which are secreted by the same cell type). The cell types are denoted by the suffix “troph,” meaning nutritive. Thus TSH is secreted by  thyrotrophs  (5%), FSH and LH by  gonadotrophs (15%), ACTH by  corticotrophs  (15%), growth hormone by  somatotrophs  (20%), and prolactin by  lactotrophs (15%). (The percentages give the representation of each cell type in the anterior pituitary gland.) Each of the anterior pituitary hormones is a peptide or polypeptide. As described, the synthesis of peptide hormones includes the following steps: transcription of DNA to mRNA in the nucleus; translation of mRNA to a preprohormone on the ribosomes; and post- translational modification of the preprohormone on the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus to produce the final hormone. The hormone is stored in membrane-bound secretory granules for subsequent release. When the anterior pituitary is stimulated by a hypothalamic-releasing hormone or a release-inhibiting hormone (e.g., thyrotrophs are stimulated by TRH to is stimulated, the neurosecretory vesicles are released from the nerve terminals by exocytosis and the secreted hormone enters nearby fenestrated capillaries. Venous blood from the posterior pituitary enters the systemic circulation, which delivers the hormones to their target tissues. In summary, the relationship between the hypothala- mus and the posterior pituitary is straightforward—a hormone-secreting neuron has its cell body in the hypothalamus and its axons in the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Relationship of the Hypothalamus to the Anterior Pituitary The anterior lobe of the pituitary gland is derived from primitive foregut. Unlike the posterior lobe, which is neural tissue, the anterior lobe is primarily a collection of endocrine cells. The anterior pituitary secretes six peptide hormones: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), FSH, LH, growth hormone, prolactin, and adrenocorti- cotropic hormone (ACTH). The nature of the relationship between the hypo- thalamus and the anterior pituitary is both neural and endocrine (in contrast to the posterior lobe, which is only neural). The hypothalamus and anterior pituitary are linked directly by the  hypothalamic-hypophysial portal blood vessels,  which provide most of the blood supply of the anterior lobe. There are both long and short hypophysial portal vessels, which are distinguished as follows: Arterial blood is delivered to the hypothalamus via the superior hypophysial arteries, which distribute the blood in a capillary network in the median eminence, called the primary capillary plexuses. These primary capillary plexuses converge to form the  long  hypophysial portal vessels,  which travel down the infundibulum to deliver hypothalamic venous blood to the anterior lobe of the pituitary. A parallel capillary plexus forms from the inferior hypophysial arteries in the lower portion of the infundibular stem. These capillaries converge to form the  short  hypophysial portal vessels,  which deliver blood to the anterior lobe of the pituitary. In summary, the blood supply of the anterior pituitary differs from that of other organs: Most of its blood supply is  venous blood from the hypothalamus, supplied by the long and short hypophysial portal vessels. There are two important physiologic implications of the portal blood supply to the anterior lobe of the pituitary: (1) The hypothalamic hormones can be delivered to the anterior pituitary directly and in high concentration, and (2) the hypothalamic hormones do not appear in the systemic circulation in high concen- trations. The cells of the anterior pituitary, therefore, are the only cells in the body to receive high concentra- tions of the hypothalamic hormones. 410    •    Physiology α  and  β  subunits begins in the endoplasmic reticulum and continues in the Golgi apparatus. In the secretory granules, the paired molecules are refolded into more stable forms prior to secretion. The placental hormone  human chorionic gonado- tropin (HCG)  is structurally related to the TSH-FSH-LH family. Thus HCG is a glycoprotein with the identical α  chain and its own  β  chain, which confers its biologic specificity. ACTH Family The ACTH family is derived from a single precursor, pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC).  The ACTH family includes ACTH,  γ - and  β -lipotropin,  β -endorphin, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). ACTH is the only hormone in this family with well-established physiologic actions in humans. MSH is involved in pigmentation in lower vertebrates but has some activity in humans.  β -Endorphin is an endogenous opiate. The preprohormone for this group,  prepro- opiomelanocortin,  is transcribed from a single gene. The signal peptide is cleaved in the endoplasmic reticu- lum, yielding POMC, the precursor to the ACTH family. Endopeptidases then hydrolyze peptide bonds in POMC and intermediates to produce the members of the ACTH family ( Fig. 9.10 ). The anterior pituitary in humans produces mainly ACTH,  γ -lipotropin, and  β -endorphin. It is noteworthy that MSH activity is found in POMC and in several of its products: The “fragment,” which is left over from hydrolysis of the ACTH intermediate, con- tains  γ -MSH; ACTH contains  α -MSH; and  γ -lipotropin secrete TSH), there is exocytosis of the secretory gran- ules; the anterior pituitary hormone (e.g., TSH) enters capillary blood and is delivered by the systemic circula- tion to the target tissue (e.g., thyroid gland). The hormones of the anterior lobe are organized in “families” according to their structural and functional homology. TSH, FSH, and LH are structurally related and constitute one family, ACTH is part of a second family, and growth hormone and prolactin constitute a third family. TSH, FSH, LH, and ACTH are discussed briefly in this section and later in the chapter in the context of their actions. (TSH is discussed within the context of the thyroid gland. ACTH is discussed in the context of the adrenal cortex. FSH and LH are discussed in Chapter 10 with male and female reproductive physiol- ogy.) Growth hormone and prolactin are discussed in this section. TSH, FSH, and LH Family TSH, FSH, and LH are all  glycoproteins  with sugar moieties covalently linked to asparagine residues in their polypeptide chains. Each hormone consists of two subunits,  α  and  β , which are not covalently linked; none of the subunits alone is biologically active. The  α subunits  of TSH, FSH, and LH are identical and are — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 9 Endocrine Physiology, Anterior Lobe Hormones, Halaman 412, 413
[71] She is found to have ovaries but no testes. Tests confirm that the baby has a form of adrenal hyperplasia in which there is congenital lack of the adrenal cortical enzyme 21 β -hydroxylase. Treatment involves surgical reconstruction of the external genitalia to conform to the female phenotype and the administration of gluco- corticoids and mineralocorticoids. The child will be raised as a female. EXPLANATION OF CASE.   The baby has a congenital absence of 21 β -hydroxylase, the adrenal enzyme that normally converts steroid precursors to mineralocorti- coids and cortisol (see Chapter 9, Fig. 9.23). As a result of this defect, steroid precursors accumulate behind the enzyme block and are directed toward the production of the adrenal androgens, dehydroepiandrosterone and androstenedione. The high levels of androgens caused masculinization of the external genitalia (enlargement of the clitoris) in utero. The genotype is XX (female), and the internal organs are female including ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina. The fallopian tubes, uterus, and upper vagina developed because, without testes, there was no source of antimüllerian hormone to suppress differentiation of müllerian ducts into the female genital tract. There is hyperplasia of the adrenal cortex because the absence of cortisol increases secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), which then has a trophic effect on the adrenal cortex. TREATMENT.   Surgical correction of the ambiguous external genitalia involves reconstruction to conform to a phenotypic female. Because the baby has normal ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus, she should begin normal menstrual cycles at puberty and have a normal reproductive capacity. Hormone replacement therapy has two goals: (1) to replace the missing adrenal glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids and (2) to suppress ACTH secretion (by the negative feedback of glucocorticoids on the anterior pituitary) to reduce the adrenal output of androgens and prevent further masculinization.

In  boys,  puberty is associated with activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, Leydig cell proliferation in the testes, and increased synthesis and secretion of testosterone by the Leydig cells. There is growth of the testes, largely because of an increased number of semi- niferous tubules. There is growth of the sex accessory organs such as the prostate. There is a pronounced linear growth spurt, and the epiphyses close when adult height is attained. As plasma levels of testosterone increase, facial, pubic, and axillary hair appears and there is growth of the penis, lowering of the voice due to increased size of the larynx and vocal cords, and initiation of spermatogenesis  (spermarche). In  girls,  puberty also is associated with the activa- tion of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis, which drives the synthesis of estradiol by the ovaries. The first Pulsatile Secretion of GnRH, FSH, and LH The primary event at puberty is the initiation of  pulsa- tile secretion of GnRH.  This new pattern of GnRH secretion drives a parallel  pulsatile secretion of FSH and LH  by the anterior lobe of the pituitary. One of the earliest events of puberty is the appearance of large nocturnal pulses of LH during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Another significant event early in puberty is an increased sensitivity of the GnRH receptor in the anterior pituitary. Thus at puberty, GnRH up-regulates its own receptor in the anterior pituitary, and a given concentration of GnRH produces a greater stimulation of FSH and LH secretion. In addition, there is a shift in the relative secretion rates of the two anterior pituitary hormones; at puberty and throughout the reproductive period, LH levels are greater than FSH levels (compared with childhood and senescence, when FSH is greater than LH). Pulsatile secretion of FSH and LH stimulates secre- tion of the gonadal steroid hormones, testosterone and estradiol. Increased circulating levels of the sex steroid hormones are then responsible for the appearance of the secondary sex characteristics at puberty. The onset of the maturational process at puberty is genetically programmed, and familial patterns are evident. For example, the age at menarche (the onset of menses) is similar between mothers and daughters. The mechanisms underlying the onset of pulsatile GnRH secretion, however, remain a mystery. There may be gradual maturation of the hypothalamic neurons that synthesize and secrete GnRH. The central nervous system and nutritional status may alter the process; for example, extreme stress or caloric deprivation in girls delays the onset of puberty. It has been suggested that melatonin plays a role in the onset of puberty. Melato- nin, secreted by the pineal gland,  may be  a natural inhibitor of GnRH release. Melatonin levels are highest during childhood and decline in adulthood, and this decline may release an inhibition of GnRH secretion. In support of a role for melatonin is the observation that removal of the pineal gland precipitates early puberty. Characteristics of Puberty As noted, the biologic events at puberty are set in motion by the onset of pulsatile activity in the hypothalamic–anterior pituitary axis. In turn, this pulsatile, or bursting, activity causes the testes and ovaries to secrete their respective sex hormones, tes- tosterone and estrogen, that are responsible for the development of the secondary sex characteristics. Pulsatility of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis is  required for normal reproductive function, as illustrated by the treatment of persons with delayed puberty caused by EVENTS OF PUBERTY Male Female Age (years) 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Pubic hair Penile growth Growth spurt Age (years) 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 Pubic hair Menarche Spermarchy Budding Breast development Growth spurt Fig. 10.3    Major events of puberty in males and females. 466    •    Physiology Spermatogenesis Spermatogenesis occurs continuously throughout the — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 10 Reproductive Physiology, Puberty, Male Reproductive Physiology, Halaman 468, 469, 467
[72] testes is much greater than testosterone synthesis from adrenal androgenic precursors. In females, however, glycerol to the liver for gluconeogenesis. Finally, cortisol decreases glucose utilization by tissues and decreases the insulin sensitivity of adipose tissue. Glucocorticoids are essential for  survival during fasting  because they stimulate these gluco- neogenic routes. In hypocortisolism (e.g., primary adrenal insufficiency, Addison disease), there is hypoglycemia. In hypercortisolism (e.g., Cushing syndrome), there is hyperglycemia. ♦	  Anti-inflammatory effects.  Cortisol has three actions that interfere with the body’s inflammatory response to trauma and irritants. (1) Cortisol induces the synthesis of  lipocortin,  an inhibitor of the enzyme phospholipase A 2 . Phospholipase A 2  liberates arachi- donic acid from membrane phospholipids and pro- vides the precursor for the prostaglandins and leukotrienes that mediate the inflammatory response. Therefore this component of the anti-inflammatory effect of cortisol is based on inhibiting the synthesis of the precursor to prostaglandins and leukotrienes. (2) Cortisol inhibits the production of  interleukin-2 (IL-2)  and the proliferation of T lymphocytes. (3) Cortisol inhibits the release of  histamine  and  sero- tonin  from mast cells and platelets. ♦	  Suppression of immune response.  As previously noted, cortisol inhibits the production of IL-2 and the proliferation of T lymphocytes, which also are critical for cellular immunity. Exogenous glucocorti- coids can be administered therapeutically to sup- press the immune response and prevent the rejection of transplanted organs. ♦	  Maintenance of vascular responsiveness to catecholamines.  Cortisol is necessary for the maintenance of normal blood pressure and plays a permissive role in the arterioles by up-regulating α 1 -adrenergic receptors. In this way, cortisol is required for the vasoconstrictive response of the arterioles to catecholamines. In hypocortisolism, there is hypotension; in hypercortisolism, there is hypertension. ♦	  Inhibition of bone formation.  Cortisol inhibits bone formation by decreasing the synthesis of type I col- lagen, the major component of bone matrix; by decreasing formation of new bone by osteoblasts; and by decreasing intestinal Ca 2 +  absorption. ♦	  Increases in glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Cortisol increases GFR by causing vasodilation of afferent arterioles, thereby increasing renal blood flow and GFR. ♦	  Effects on CNS.  Glucocorticoid receptors are found in the brain, particularly in the limbic system. Cor- tisol decreases REM sleep, increases slow-wave sleep, and increases awake time. (Recall that the 436    •    Physiology secondary effect on the adrenal cortex. The etiology of the disorder may not be deduced until circulating levels of CRH and ACTH are measured and the feedback regulation of the CRH-ACTH axis is evaluated. For disorders caused by enzyme deficiencies in the steroid hormone biosynthetic pathway, the pathways can be visualized to predict the effects of a given enzyme block (see  Fig. 9.23 ). For example, a woman with masculinization also has symptoms consistent with aldosterone deficiency (e.g., hyperkalemia) and cortisol deficiency (e.g., hypoglycemia). This constellation of symptoms suggests that there is an enzyme block preventing the synthesis of all miner- alocorticoids and all glucocorticoids (e.g., deficiency of 21 β -hydroxylase). Because of the block, steroid intermediates are “shunted” toward androgen pro- duction and the increased adrenal androgen levels cause masculinization. To understand the patho- physiology of the adrenal cortex, use the biosynthetic pathway shown in  Figure 9.23  in combination with the actions of the steroid hormones summarized in Table 9.11 . The features of each disorder are sum- marized in  Table 9.12 . Addison Disease Addison disease, or  primary adrenocortical insuffi- ciency,  is commonly caused by autoimmune destruc- tion of all zones of the adrenal cortex ( Box 9.2 ). In this disease, there is decreased synthesis of all adrenocorti- cal hormones, resulting in decreased circulating levels of cortisol, aldosterone, and adrenal androgens. The symptoms of Addison disease can be predicted on the basis of the known physiologic effects of these hor- mones. The loss of glucocorticoids (cortisol) produces hypoglycemia, anorexia, weight loss, nausea and vomiting, and weakness. The loss of mineralocorticoids (aldosterone) produces hyperkalemia, metabolic acido- sis, and hypotension (due to decreased ECF volume). In women, the loss of the adrenal androgens, DHEA and androstenedione, results in decreased pubic and axillary hair and decreased libido. Addison disease also is characterized by  hyper- pigmentation  of the skin, particularly of the elbows, knees, nail beds, nipples, and areolae and on recent scars. Hyperpigmentation is a result of  increased levels of ACTH  (which contains the  α -MSH fragment). Hyper- pigmentation therefore provides an important clue about the etiology of Addison disease: ACTH levels must be high, not low, and the cause of the hypocorti- solism must  not  be a primary defect in ACTH secretion from the anterior pituitary. Rather, the hypocortisolism of Addison disease must be due to a primary defect in the adrenal cortex itself (i.e., primary adrenal insuf- ficiency), with low levels of cortisol then causing an adrenal androgens are the  major  androgens, and they are responsible for the development of pubic and axil- lary hair and for libido. In conditions such as  adrenogenital syndrome,  in which there is increased synthesis of adrenal andro- gens, the high levels of DHEA and androstenedione lead to masculinization in females, early development of axillary and pubic hair, and suppression of gonadal function in both males and females. Also, in the adre- nogenital syndromes, due to the overproduction of adrenal androgens, there will be increased urinary levels of  17-ketosteroids. Pathophysiology of the Adrenal Cortex Disorders involving the adrenal cortex are character- ized by either an excess or a deficiency of adrenocortical hormones. When evaluating the pathophysiology of these disorders, it is helpful to consider the following issues: 1.	 What are the symptoms and signs? Are the signs and symptoms consistent with an excess or a deficiency of one or more of the adrenocortical hormones? The normal physiologic effects of each of the adrenocor- tical hormones can be used to predict the effects of hormonal excess or deficiency (see  Table 9.11 ). A few examples are cited here. Cortisol  promotes gluconeogenesis, and therefore, excess levels of cortisol will produce hyperglycemia; deficits of cortisol will produce hypoglycemia upon fasting.  Aldosterone  causes increased K +  secretion by the renal principal cells; thus excess aldosterone will cause increased K +  secretion and hypokalemia, and deficiency of aldosterone will cause decreased K + — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 9 Endocrine Physiology, Adrenal Medulla and Cortex, Halaman 439, 438

The growth-promoting effects of growth hormone are mediated largely through produc- tion of somatomedins. The actions of growth hormone are described as follows: ♦	  Diabetogenic or anti-insulin effect. Growth hormone causes  insulin resistance  and decreases glucose uptake and utilization by target tissues such as muscle and adipose tissue. These effects are called “diabetogenic” because they produce an increase in blood glucose concentration, as occurs when insulin is lacking or when tissues are resistant to insulin (e.g., diabetes mellitus). Growth hormone also increases lipolysis in adipose tissue. As a conse- quence of these metabolic effects, growth hormone causes an increase in blood insulin levels. ♦	  Increased protein synthesis and organ growth.  In virtually all organs, growth hormone increases the uptake of amino acids and stimulates the synthesis of DNA, RNA, and protein. These effects account for the hormone’s growth-promoting actions: increased lean body mass and increased organ size. As noted, many of the growth effects of growth hormone are mediated by somatomedins. ♦	  Increased linear growth.  The most striking effect of growth hormone is its ability to increase linear growth. Mediated by the somatomedins, growth hormone alters every aspect of cartilage metabolism: stimulation of DNA synthesis, RNA synthesis, and protein synthesis. In growing bones, the epiphyseal Growth hormone secretion is regulated by negative feedback (see  Fig. 9.11 ). Three feedback loops includ- ing both long and short loops are involved. (1) GHRH inhibits its own secretion from the hypothalamus via an ultrashort-loop feedback. (2) Somatomedins, which are byproducts of the growth hormone action on target tissues, inhibit secretion of growth hormone by the anterior pituitary. (3) Both growth hormone and somatomedins stimulate the secretion of somatostatin by the hypothalamus. The overall effect of this third loop is  inhibitory  (i.e., negative feedback) because somatostatin inhibits growth hormone secretion by the anterior pituitary. Actions of Growth Hormone Growth hormone has multiple metabolic actions on liver, muscle, adipose tissue, and bone, as well as growth-promoting actions in virtually every other organ. The actions of growth hormone include effects on linear growth, protein synthesis and organ growth, carbohydrate metabolism, and lipid metabolism. Some of the actions of growth hormone result from the hormone’s  direct  effect on target tissues such as skeletal muscle, the liver, or adipose tissue. These direct actions are mediated by  tyrosine kinase– associated receptors.  Other actions of growth hormone are mediated  indirectly  through the production of somatomedins  (or IGFs) in the liver. The most impor- tant of the somatomedins is somatomedin C or  IGF-1. Somatomedins act on target tissues through IGF recep- tors that are similar to the insulin receptor, having intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity  and exhibiting Hypothalamus Anterior pituitary Target tissues Somatomedins (IGFs) GHRH Somatostatin (SRIF) Growth hormone Somatomedins (IGFs) + – + + – – Fig. 9.11    Regulation of growth hormone secretion.

The number of lactotrophs increases during pregnancy and lactation when the demand for prolactin is increased. Chemically, prolactin is related to growth hormone, having  198 amino acids in a  single-chain polypeptide  with 3 internal disulfide bridges. Stimuli that increase or decrease prolactin secretion do so by altering transcription of the prolactin gene. Thus TRH, a stimulant of prolactin secretion, increases transcription of the prolactin gene, whereas dopamine, an inhibitor of prolactin secretion, decreases transcrip- tion of the gene. Regulation of Prolactin Secretion Figure 9.12  illustrates the hypothalamic control of prolactin secretion. There are two regulatory paths from the hypothalamus, one inhibitory (via dopamine, which acts by decreasing cAMP levels) and the other stimulatory (via TRH). In persons who are not pregnant or lactating, pro- lactin secretion is  tonically inhibited by dopamine (prolactin-inhibiting factor [PIF]) from the hypothala- mus. In other words, the inhibitory effect of dopamine dominates and overrides the stimulatory effect of TRH. In contrast to other hypothalamic-releasing or release- inhibiting hormones, which are peptides, dopamine is a catecholamine. Two questions arise regarding this inhibitory action of dopamine:  What is the source of hypothalamic plates widen and more bone is laid down at the ends of long bones. There also is increased metabo- lism in cartilage-forming cells and proliferation of chondrocytes. Pathophysiology of Growth Hormone The pathophysiology of growth hormone includes deficiency or excess of the hormone, with predictable effects on linear growth, organ growth, and carbohy- drate and lipid metabolism. Growth hormone deficiency  in children causes dwarfism,  including failure to grow, short stature, mild obesity, and delayed puberty. The causes of growth hormone deficiency include defects at every step in the hypothalamic–anterior pituitary–target tissue axis: decreased secretion of GHRH due to hypothalamic dysfunction; primary deficiencies of growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary; failure to gen- erate somatomedins in the liver; and deficiency of growth hormone or somatomedin receptors in target tissues (growth hormone resistance). Growth hormone deficiency in children is treated with human growth hormone replacement. One variant of dwarfism is Laron dwarfism,  in which growth hormone levels are elevated and treatment with growth hormone is ineff­ ective. In these individuals, growth hormone receptors are defective; thus growth hormone cannot cause production of IGFs in target tissues. Growth hormone excess  causes  acromegaly  and is most often due to a growth hormone–secreting pituitary adenoma. The consequences of excess growth hormone differ, depending on whether the excess occurs before or after puberty. Before puberty, excessive levels of growth hormone cause  gigantism  (increased linear growth) because of intense hormonal stimulation at the epiphyseal plates. After puberty, when linear growth is complete and can no longer be influenced, excess levels of growth hormone cause increased periosteal bone growth, increased organ size, increased hand and foot size, enlargement of the tongue, coarsen- — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 9 Endocrine Physiology, Anterior Lobe Hormones, Halaman 416, 414, 415

As a consequence, the eye exhibits some unusual pharmacody­ namic and pharmacokinetic properties. Extraocular Structures The eye is protected by the eyelids and by the orbit, a bony cavity of the skull that has multiple fissures and foramina that conduct nerves, mus­ cles, and vessels (Figure 74–1). In the orbit, connective (i.e.,  Tenon’s cap­ sule ) and adipose tissues and six extraocular muscles support and align the eyes for vision. The retrobulbar region lies immediately behind the eye (or  globe ). Understanding ocular and orbital anatomy is important for safe periocular drug delivery, including subconjunctival, sub-Tenon, and peribulbar or retrobulbar injections. The external surface of the eyelids is covered by a thin layer of skin; the internal surface is lined with the palpebral portion of the conjunctiva, which is a vascularized mucous membrane continuous with the bulbar conjunctiva. At the reflection of the palpebral and bulbar conjunctivae is a space called the  fornix , located superiorly and inferiorly behind the upper and lower eyelids, respectively. Topical medications usually are placed in the inferior fornix, also known as the  inferior cul-de-sac . The lacrimal system consists of secretory glandular and excretory ductal elements (Figure 74–2). The secretory system is composed of the main  lacrimal gland , which is located in the temporal outer portion of the orbit, and accessory glands located in the conjunctiva. The lacri­ mal gland is innervated by the autonomic nervous system (Table 74–1 and Chapter 10). The parasympathetic innervation is clinically relevant because a patient may complain of dry eye symptoms while taking medi­ cations with anticholinergic side effects, such as tricyclic antidepressants (see Chapter 18), antihistamines (see Chapter 43), and drugs used in the management of Parkinson’s disease (see Chapter 21). Muscarinic cholin­ ergic and α adrenergic receptors that mediate responses of several pupil­ lary muscles from autonomic nerves also provide means of dilating the pupil for examination of posterior structures.

[75] or progesterone) could prevent the initial ovarian hormonal depression that might be the initiating signal for ovulation. The challenge in devising methods for the hormonal suppression of ovulation has been in developing appropri­ ate combinations of estrogens and progestins that suppress ovulation but do not cause other, unwanted effects. For example, too much of either hormone can cause abnor­ mal menstrual bleeding patterns. However, use of certain synthetic progestins in place of progesterone, especially the 19-­norsteroids, along with small amounts of estrogens, usually prevents ovulation yet allows an almost normal pattern of menstruation. Therefore, almost all “pills” used for the control of fertility consist of some combination of synthetic estrogens and synthetic progestins. The main reason for using synthetic estrogens and progestins is that the  natural  hormones are almost entirely destroyed by the liver within a short time after they are absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into the portal circulation. However, many of the  synthetic  hormones can resist this destructive propensity of the liver, thus allowing oral administration. Two of the most commonly used synthetic estrogens are ethinyl estradiol  and  mestranol.  Among the most commonly used progestins are  norethindrone, norethynodrel, ethynodi­ ol,  and  norgestrel.  The drug is usually begun in the early stag­ es of the monthly cycle and continued beyond the time that ovulation would normally occur. Then the drug is stopped, allowing menstruation to occur and a new cycle to begin. The failure rate, resulting in an unintentional pregnancy, for hormonal suppression of fertility using various forms of the “pill” is about 8% to 9% per year. Abnormal Conditions That Cause Female Sterility About 5% to 10% of women are infertile. Occasionally, no abnormality can be discovered in the female genital organs, in which case the infertility is assumed to be due to either abnormal physiological function of the genital system or abnormal genetic development of the ova. The most common cause of female sterility is failure to ovulate. This failure can result from hyposecretion of gon­ adotropic hormones, in which case the intensity of the hor­ monal stimuli is simply insufficient to cause ovulation, or it can result from abnormal ovaries that do not allow ovula­ tion. For example, thick ovarian capsules occasionally exist on the outsides of the ovaries, making ovulation difficult. Because of the high incidence of anovulation in ster­ ile women, special methods are often used to determine whether ovulation occurs. These methods are based mainly on the effects of progesterone on the body because the nor­ mal increase in progesterone secretion usually does not occur during the latter half of anovulatory cycles. In the absence of progestational effects, the cycle can be assumed to be anovulatory. One of these tests is simply to analyze the urine for a surge in pregnanediol, the end product of progester­ one metabolism, during the latter half of the sexual cycle; the lack of this substance indicates failure of ovulation. Another common test is for the woman to chart her body temperature throughout the cycle. Secretion of progester­ one during the latter half of the cycle raises the body temper­ ature about 0.5°F, with the temperature rise coming abruptly at the time of ovulation. Such a temperature chart, showing the point of ovulation, is illustrated in  Figure 82-­14 . Lack of ovulation caused by hyposecretion of the pi­ tuitary gonadotropic hormones can sometimes be treated by appropriately timed administration of  human chorionic gonadotropin,  a hormone (discussed in  Chapter 83 ) that is extracted from the human placenta. This hormone, al­ though secreted by the placenta, has almost the same effects as LH and is therefore a powerful stimulator of ovulation. However, excess use of this hormone can cause ovulation from many follicles simultaneously, which results in multi­ ple births, an effect that has caused as many as eight babies (stillborn in many cases) to be born to mothers treated for infertility with this hormone. One of the most common causes of female sterility is endometriosis,  a common condition in which endometrial tissue almost identical to that of the normal uterine endo­ metrium grows and even menstruates in the pelvic cavity surrounding the uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries. En­ dometriosis causes fibrosis throughout the pelvis, and this fibrosis sometimes so enshrouds the ovaries that an ovum cannot be released into the abdominal cavity. Often, endo­ metriosis occludes the fallopian tubes, either at the fimbri­ ated ends or elsewhere along their extent. Another common cause of female infertility is  salpin­ gitis,  that is,  inflammation of the fallopian tubes;  this in­ flammation causes fibrosis in the tubes, thereby occluding them. In the past, such inflammation occurred mainly as a result of gonococcal infection. However, with modern therapy, salpingitis is becoming a less prevalent cause of female infertility. Still another cause of infertility is secretion of abnor­ mal mucus by the uterine cervix. Ordinarily, at the time of ovulation, the hormonal environment of estrogen causes secretion of mucus with special characteristics that allow rapid mobility of sperm into the uterus and actually guide the sperm up along mucous “threads.” Abnormalities of the cervix, such as low-­grade infection or inflammation, or ab­ normal hormonal stimulation of the cervix, can lead to a viscous mucous plug that prevents fertilization. 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 26 28 0 99° 98° 97° Day of cycle Body temperature (°F) Ovulation Figure 82-­14.   Elevation in body temperature shortly after ovulation.

In women, these include developmental effects, neu­ roendocrine actions involved in the control of ovulation, the cyclical prepa­ ration of the reproductive tract for fertilization and implantation, and major actions on mineral, carbohydrate, protein, and lipid metabolism. Estrogens also have important actions in males, including effects on bone, sperma­ togenesis, and behavior. Well-characterized receptors for each hormone mediate biological actions in both the unliganded and the liganded states. The most common uses of estrogens and progestins are for contracep­ tion and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) in women, but the specific compounds and dosages used in these two settings differ substantially. Antiestrogens are used in the treatment of hormone-responsive breast cancer and infertility. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) that display tissue-selective agonist or antagonist activities are useful to prevent breast cancer and osteoporosis. The main use of antiprogestins has been for medical abortion. Several naturally occurring and synthetic environmental chemicals mimic, antagonize, or otherwise affect the actions of estrogens in exper­ imental test systems. The precise effect of these agents on humans is unknown but is an area of active investigation. Estrogens Chemistry and Synthesis Chemistry Many steroidal and nonsteroidal compounds, some of which are shown in Table 48–1 and Figure 48–1, possess estrogenic activity. Estrogens interact with two receptors of the nuclear receptor superfamily, termed ERα and ERβ. The most potent naturally occurring estrogen in humans, for both ERα- and ERβ-mediated actions, is  17β-estradiol , followed by estrone  and  estriol . Each contains a phenolic A ring with a hydroxyl group at carbon 3 and a β-OH or ketone in position 17 of ring D. The phenolic A ring is the principal structural feature responsible for selective high-affinity binding to both receptors. Most alkyl sub­ stitutions on the A ring impair binding, but substitutions on ring C or D may be tolerated. Ethinyl substitutions at the C17 position greatly increase oral potency by inhibiting first-pass hepatic metabolism. Models for the ligand-binding sites of both ERs have been determined from structure-activity relationships and structural analysis (Pike et al., 2000). Selective ligands for ERα and ERβ are available for experimental studies but are not yet used therapeutically (Harrington et al., 2003). Biosynthesis Steroidal estrogens arise from androstenedione or testosterone (Figure 48–1) by aromatization of the A ring. The reaction is catalyzed by aromatase (CYP19), which uses NADPH and molecular oxygen as cosubstrates. A ubiquitous flavoprotein, NADPH–cytochrome P450 reductase, also is essential. Both proteins are localized in the endo­ plasmic reticulum of ovarian granulosa cells, testicular Sertoli and Leydig cells, adipose stroma, placental syncytiotrophoblasts, preimplan­ tation blastocysts, bone, various brain regions, and many other tissues (Simpson et al., 2002). The ovaries are the principal source of circulating estrogen in pre­ menopausal women, with estradiol the main secretory product. Ovarian estradiol production is traditionally thought to require two cell types: theca cells and granulosa cells. The gonadotropin luteinizing hormone (LH) acts via receptors that couple to the G s -adenylyl cyclase–cyclic AMP 48 Chapter Estrogens, Progestins, and the Female Reproductive Tract Ellis R.

Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) then stimulates CYP19 production and activity in the granulosa cells, which converts the androgen pre­ cursors to estrogens. Notably, theca cells of the ovary contain a form of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (type I) that favors the production of testosterone and estradiol from androstenedione and estrone, respec­ tively. However, in the liver, another form of this enzyme (type II) favors oxidation of circulating estradiol to estrone (Peltoketo et al., 1999), and both of these steroids are then converted to estriol (Figure 48–1). All three of these estrogens are excreted in the urine along with their glucu­ ronide and sulfate conjugates. — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[77] mother enlarges at least 50% during pregnancy and increas­ es its production of  adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH), thyrotropin,  and  prolactin.  Conversely, pituitary secretion of follicle-­stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone is almost totally suppressed as a result of the inhibitory ef­ fects of estrogens and progesterone from the placenta. Increased Corticosteroid Secretion .  The rate of adreno­ cortical secretion of  glucocorticoids  is moderately increased throughout pregnancy. It is possible that these glucocorti­ coids help mobilize amino acids from the mother’s tissues to be used for synthesis of fetal tissues. Pregnant women usually have about a 2-­fold increase in  aldosterone  secretion ,  reaching a peak at the end of ges­ tation. This increase, along with the actions of estrogens, causes a tendency for even a normal pregnant woman to reabsorb excess sodium from her renal tubules and, there­ fore, to retain fluid. Increased Thyroid Gland Secretion .  The mother’s thy­ roid gland ordinarily enlarges up to 50% during pregnancy and increases its production of thyroxine a corresponding amount. The increased thyroxine production is caused at least partly by a thyrotropic effect of  human chorionic gon­ adotropin  secreted by the placenta and by small quantities of a specific thyroid-­stimulating hormone,  human chori­ onic thyrotropin,  also secreted by the placenta. Increased Parathyroid Gland Secretion .  The mother’s parathyroid glands usually enlarge during pregnancy, es­ pecially if her diet is deficient in calcium. Enlargement of these glands causes calcium absorption from the mother’s bones, thereby maintaining normal calcium ion concentra­ tion in the mother’s extracellular fluid, even while the fetus removes calcium to ossify its own bones. This secretion of parathyroid hormone is even greater during lactation after the baby’s birth because the growing baby requires many times more calcium than does the fetus. Secretion of “Relaxin” by the Ovaries and Placenta .  A hormone called  relaxin  is also secreted by the corpus lu­ teum of the ovary and by placental tissues. Its secretion is increased by a stimulating effect of human chorionic gonad­ otropin at the same time that the corpus luteum and the pla­ centa secrete large quantities of estrogens and progesterone. Relaxin is a 48–amino acid polypeptide with a molec­ ular weight of about 9000. This hormone, when injected, causes relaxation of the ligaments of the symphysis pubis UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 1052 in the estrous rat and guinea pig. This effect is weak or pos­ sibly even absent in pregnant women. Instead, this role is probably played mainly by the estrogens, which also cause relaxation of the pelvic ligaments. It has also been claimed that relaxin softens the cervix of the pregnant woman at the time of delivery. Relaxin is also thought to serve as a vasodilator, contributing to increased blood flow in vari­ ous tissues, including the kidneys, and increasing venous return and cardiac output in pregnancy. Response of the Mother’s Body to Pregnancy Most apparent among the many reactions of the mother to the fetus and to the higher levels of pregnancy hormones is the increased size of the various sexual organs. For exam­ ple, the uterus increases from about 50 to 1100 grams, and the breasts approximately double in size. At the same time, the vagina enlarges and the introitus opens more widely. Also, the various hormones can cause marked changes in a pregnant woman’s appearance, sometimes resulting in the development of edema, acne, and masculine or acromegalic features. Weight Gain in the Pregnant Woman The average weight gain during pregnancy is about 25 to 35 pounds, with most of this gain occurring during the last two trimesters. Of this added weight, about 8 pounds is fetus and 4 pounds is amniotic fluid, placenta, and fetal membranes. The uterus increases about 3 pounds and the breasts another 2 pounds, still leaving an average weight increase of 8 to 18 pounds. About 5 pounds of this added weight is extra fluid in the blood and extracellular fluid, and the remaining 3 to 13 pounds is generally fat accumulation. The extra fluid is excret­ ed in the urine during the first few days after birth—that is, after loss of the fluid-­retaining hormones from the placenta. During pregnancy, a woman often has a greatly in­ creased desire for food, partly as a result of removal of food substrates from the mother’s blood by the fetus and partly because of hormonal factors. Without appropriate prenatal control of diet, the mother’s weight gain can be as great as 75 pounds instead of the usual 25 to 35 pounds. Metabolism During Pregnancy As a consequence of the increased secretion of many hor­ mones during pregnancy, including thyroxine, adrenocor­ tical hormones, and the sex hormones, the basal metabolic rate of the pregnant woman increases about 15% during the latter half of pregnancy. As a result, she frequently has sen­ sations of becoming overheated. Also, owing to the extra load she is carrying, greater amounts of energy than normal must be expended for muscle activity. Nutrition During Pregnancy By far the greatest growth of the fetus occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy; its weight almost doubles during the last 2 months of pregnancy. Ordinarily, the mother does not absorb sufficient protein, calcium, phosphates, and iron from her diet during the last months of pregnancy to sup­ ply these extra needs of the fetus. However, in anticipation of these extra needs, the mother’s body has already been storing these substances—some in the placenta, but most in the normal storage depots of the mother. If appropriate nutritional elements are not present in a pregnant woman’s diet, several maternal deficiencies can occur, especially in calcium, phosphates, iron, and the vita­ mins. For example, the fetus needs about 375 milligrams of iron to form its blood, and the mother needs an additional 600 milligrams to form her own extra blood. The normal store of nonhemoglobin iron in the mother at the outset of pregnancy is often only 100 milligrams and almost never more than 700 milligrams. Therefore, without sufficient iron in her food, a pregnant woman may develop  hypochro­ mic anemia . Also, it is especially important that she receive vitamin D, because although the total quantity of calcium — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 83 - Pregnancy and Lactation, Hormonal Factors in Pregnancy, Halaman 998, 997
[78] ner. If fertility is the goal, then therapy with either GnRH or gonado­ tropins is needed to stimulate appropriate germ cell maturation. •  Infertility.  Infertility, or a failure to conceive after 12 months of unprotected intercourse, is seen in up to 10% to 15% of couples and is increasing in frequency as women choose to delay childbearing. When the infertility is due to impaired synthesis or secretion of gonado­ tropins (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), various pharmacological approaches are employed. In contrast, when infertility results from intrinsic processes affecting the gonads, pharmacotherapy generally is less effective. Therapeutic approaches to male infertility are described further in this chapter; strategies for female infertility are described in Chapter 48. Treatment and Diagnosis of Gonadal Disorders GnRH and Its Synthetic Agonist Analogues A synthetic peptide comprising the native sequence of GnRH has been used both diagnostically and therapeutically in human reproductive dis­ orders. In addition, several GnRH analogues with structural modifica­ tions have been synthesized and brought to market (Table 46–3). GnRH Congeners Synthetic agonist congeners of GnRH have longer half-lives than native GnRH. After a transient stimulation of gonadotropin secretion, they downregulate the GnRH receptor and inhibit gonadotropin secretion. The available GnRH agonists contain substitutions of the native sequence at position 6 that protect against proteolysis and substitutions at the carboxyl terminus that improve receptor-binding affinity. Compared to GnRH, these analogues exhibit enhanced potency and prolonged dura­ tion of action (see Table 46–3). Pharmacokinetics.   The myriad formulations of GnRH agonists pro­ vide for diverse applications, including relatively short-term effects (e.g., assisted reproduction technology) and more prolonged action (e.g., depot forms that inhibit gonadotropin secretion in GnRH-dependent precocious puberty). The rates and extents of absorption vary con­ siderably. The intranasal formulations have bioavailability (~4%) that is considerably lower than that of the parenteral formulations, which include products for implantation and injection (subcutaneous and intramuscular). Clinical Uses.   The depot form of the GnRH agonist  leuprolide  has been used diagnostically to differentiate between GnRH-dependent and GnRH-independent precocious puberty.  Leuprolide depot  (3.75 mg) is injected subcutaneously, and serum LH is measured 2 h later. A plasma LH level of more than 6.6 mIU/mL is diagnostic of GnRH-dependent (central) disease. Clinically, the various GnRH agonists are used to achieve pharmacological castration in disorders that respond to reduc­ tion in gonadal steroids (Fuqua, 2013). A clear indication is in children with GnRH-dependent precocious puberty, whose premature sexual maturation can be arrested with minimal side effects by chronic adminis­ tration of a depot form of a GnRH agonist (Li et al., 2014).

The GnRH agonists also are used to suppress steroid-responsive conditions such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, acute intermittent porphyria, and priap­ ism. They also have been evaluated off label for their potential to preserve follicles in women undergoing therapy with cytotoxic drugs for cancer treatment, although efficacy in this setting has not been established. Depot preparations can be administered subcutaneously or intramuscu­ larly monthly or every 3 months. The long-lasting GnRH agonists have been used to avoid a premature LH surge, and thus ovulation, in various ovarian stimulation protocols for  in vitro  fertilization. Adverse Effects.   The long-acting agonists generally are well tolerated, and side effects are those that would be predicted to occur when gonadal steroidogenesis is inhibited (e.g., hot flashes and decreased bone density in both sexes, vaginal dryness and atrophy in women, and erectile dysfunc­ tion in men). Because of these effects, therapy in non–life-threatening diseases such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids generally is limited to 6 months. GnRH agonists are contraindicated in pregnant women. Formulations and Indications. Leuprolide.   Leuprolide  is formulated in multiple doses for injection: sub­ cutaneous (1 mg/day), subcutaneous depot (7.5 mg/month; 22.5 mg/3 months; 30 mg/4 months; 45 mg/6 months), and intramuscular depot (3.75 mg/month; 11.25 mg/3 months). It is approved for endometriosis, uterine fibroids, advanced prostate cancer, and precocious puberty. For endometri­ osis,  leuprolide  once-monthly injections (3.75 mg) or 3-month injections (11.25 mg) are also copackaged in combination with once-daily  norethin­ drone  (a steroidal progestin) 5-mg tablets for oral administration. Pediatric formulations of  leuprolide  also are approved for central precocious puberty. Goserelin.   Goserelin  is formulated as a subcutaneous implant (3.6 mg/ month; 10.8 mg/12 weeks). It is approved for endometriosis, for use as an endometrial-thinning agent prior to endometrial ablation for dysfunc­ tional uterine bleeding, and for advanced prostate and breast cancer. Histrelin.   Histrelin  is formulated as a subcutaneous implant (50 mg/12 months). It is approved for central precocious puberty and advanced pros­ — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[79] cause smaller beneficial changes in LDL and HDL profiles (~50% of those seen with the oral route) (Walsh et al., 1994). Tibolone  is widely used in the E.U. for treatment of vasomotor symp­ toms and prevention of osteoporosis but is not currently approved in the U.S. The parent compound itself is devoid of activity, but it is metabolized in a tissue-selective manner to three metabolites that have predominantly estrogenic, progestogenic, and androgenic activities. The effects of this drug on fractures, breast cancer, and long-term outcomes remain to be established (Modelska and Cummings, 2002). Finally, a combination of conjugated estrogens and the nonsteroidal SERM  bazedoxifene  can be used for menopausal symptoms. This combi­ nation has a neutral effect in the uterus and breast but has been shown to improve hot flashes, reduce vaginal dryness, and prevent (but not treat) bone loss (Parish and Gillespie, 2017). Regardless of the specific agent or regimen, MHT with estrogens should use the lowest dose and shortest duration necessary to achieve an appropriate therapeutic goal. Untoward Responses The use of unopposed estrogen for hormone treatment in postmeno­ pausal women increases the risk of endometrial carcinoma by 5- to 15-fold (Shapiro et al., 1985). This increased risk can be prevented if a progestin is coadministered with the estrogen (Pike et al., 1997), and this is now standard practice. The association between estrogen or estrogen-progestin use and breast cancer is of great concern. The results of two large randomized clinical trials of estrogen/progestin and estrogen only (i.e., the two arms of WHI) in postmenopausal women clearly established a small but significant increase in the risk of breast cancer in the conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) plus MPA studies (Anderson et al., 2004; Rossouw et al., 2002). In the WHI study, CEE+MPA was associated with an increased relative risk of breast cancer by 25%; the absolute increase in attributable cases of disease was 6 per 1000 women and required 3 or more years of treatment. In women without a uterus who received CEE alone, the relative risk of breast cancer was actually decreased by 23%, and the decrease only nar­ rowly missed reaching statistical significance. Interestingly, the incidence of colon cancer was reduced by 26% in the WHI trial. The Million Women Study in the U.K. was a cohort study rather than a clinical trial (Beral et al., 2003). It surveyed more than 1 million women; about half had received some type of hormone treatment, and half had never used this type of treatment. Those receiving an estrogen-progestin combination had an increased relative risk of invasive breast cancer of 2, and those receiving estrogen alone had an increased relative risk of 1.3, but the increase in actual attributable cases of the disease was again small. Both the WHI and Million Women Study data are thus consistent with earlier studies indicating that the progestin component (e.g., medroxyprogesterone ) in combined HRT plays a major role in this increased risk of breast cancer (Ross et al., 2000; Schairer et al., 2000). Importantly, although long-term data have not accumulated for the WHI trials, the available data suggest that the excess risk of breast can­ cer associated with menopausal hormone use appears to abate 5 years after discontinuing therapy. Thus, HRT for 5 years or less is often pre­ scribed to mitigate hot flashes and likely has a minimal effect on the risk of breast cancer. Historically, the carcinogenic actions of estrogens were thought to be related to their trophic effects. However, if catechol estrogens, especially the 4-hydroxycatechols, are converted to semiquinones or quinones prior to “inactivation” by catechol- O -methyl transferase, the generation of ROSs may cause direct chemical damage to DNA bases (Yue et al., 2003). In this regard, CYP1B1, which has specific estrogen-4-hydroxylase activ­ ity, is present in tissues such as uterus, breast, ovary, and prostate, which often give rise to hormone-responsive cancers. Metabolic and Cardiovascular Effects Although they may slightly elevate plasma triglycerides, estrogens them­ selves generally have favorable overall effects on plasma lipoprotein pro­ files. However, addition of progestins may reduce the favorable actions of estrogens. Estrogens do increase cholesterol levels in bile and cause a relative 2- to 3-fold increase in gallbladder disease. Currently prescribed https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 984 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT doses of estrogens generally do not increase the risk of hypertension, and estrogen engaging the ERβ receptor typically reduces blood pressure. Postmenopausal women who take HRT have a lower rate of nonal­ coholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis development than age-matched men or women not taking HRT. There is also a reduc­ tion of the abnormal metabolism in the liver, including excessive liver fat deposition that results in insulin resistance. Furthermore, the devel­ opment of liver inflammation and fibrosis is attenuated by estrogen in postmenopausal women. The latter likely contributes to preventing pro­ gression to hepatocellular carcinoma in some individuals (DiStefano, 2020). Many studies and clinical trials suggested that estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women would reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease by 35% to 50% (Manson and Martin, 2001). However, two recent ran­ domized clinical trials have not found such protection. The Heart and Estrogen/Progestin Replacement Study (HERS) study followed women with established CHD and found that estrogen plus a progestin increased the relative risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction or CHD death within 1 year of treatment, but there was no overall change at 5 years (Hulley et al., 1998). The HERS II follow-up found no overall change in the incidence of CHD after 6.8 years of the treatment (Grady et al., 2002). In women  without  existing CHD (WHI trials) treated with an estro­ gen plus progestin, protective effects were seen but only when hormone replacement was initiated within 10 years of menopause (Rossouw et al., 2002). It is clear that oral estrogens increase the risk of thromboembolic dis­ ease in healthy women and in women with preexisting cardiovascular disease (Grady et al., 2000). The increase in absolute risk is small but sig­ nificant. In the WHI, for example, an estrogen-progestin combination led to an increase in eight attributable cases of stroke per 10,000 older women — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[80] their subsequent actions on target tissues. A hormone is a chemical substance that is classi- fied as a peptide, a steroid, or an amine. Hormones are secreted into the circulation in small amounts and delivered to target tissues, where they produce physiologic responses. Hormones are synthesized and secreted by endocrine cells usually found in endocrine glands.  Table 9.1  is a list of hormones and their abbreviations, which are used throughout Chapters 9 and 10. The classic endocrine glands are the hypothalamus, anterior and posterior lobes of the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal cortex, adrenal medulla, gonads, placenta, and pancreas. The kidney also is considered to be an endocrine gland, and endocrine cells are found throughout the gastrointestinal tract.  Table 9.2  sum- marizes the major hormones, their glands of origin, their chemical nature, and their major actions. Its companion,  Figure 9.1 , is a pictorial summary of the endocrine glands and their hormonal secretions. HORMONE SYNTHESIS Hormones are categorized in one of three classes: peptides and proteins, steroids, or amines. Each class differs in its biosynthetic pathway: Peptide and protein hormones are synthesized from amino acids; steroid hormones are derivatives of cholesterol; and amine hormones are derivatives of tyrosine. Peptide and Protein Hormone Synthesis Most hormones are peptide or protein in nature. The biosynthetic pathways are familiar from biochemistry.

[82] and the deposition of subcutaneous fat (i.e., female fat distribution). Progesterone has a mild thermogenic action, which increases basal body temperature during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle. This increase in basal body temperature during the luteal phase is the basis for the “rhythm” method of contraception, in which the increase in temperature can be used retro- spectively to determine the time of ovulation. Events of the Menstrual Cycle The menstrual cycle recurs approximately every 28 days over the reproductive period of the female: from puberty until menopause. The events of the cycle include development of an ovarian follicle and its oocyte, ovulation, preparation of the reproductive tract to receive the fertilized ovum, and shedding of the endometrial lining if fertilization does not occur. The cycle length can vary from 21 to 35 days, but the average length is 28 days. The variability in cycle length is attributable to variability in the duration of the fol- licular phase; the luteal phase is constant.

The blastocyst floats freely in the uterine cavity for 1 day and then implants in the endometrium 5 days after ovulation. The receptivity of the endometrium to the fertilized ovum is criti- cally dependent on a  low estrogen/progesterone ratio  and corresponds to the period of highest pro- gesterone output by the corpus luteum. At the time of implantation, the blastocyst consists of an inner mass of cells, which will become the fetus, and an outer rim of cells called the  trophoblast.  The tro- phoblast invades the endometrium and forms an attachment to the maternal membranes. Thus the trophoblast contributes the  fetal  portion of the pla- centa. At the point of implantation, under stimula- tion by progesterone, the endometrium differentiates into a specialized layer of  decidual cells.  Eventually, the decidua will envelop the entire conceptus. Tro- phoblastic cells proliferate and form the  syncytiotro- phoblast,  whose function is to allow the blastocyst to penetrate deep into the endometrium. 3.	  Secretion of HCG and “rescue” of the corpus luteum.  The trophoblast, which will become the placenta, begins secreting HCG approximately 8 days after ovulation. HCG, which has biologic activity similar to LH, is critical because it “informs” the corpus luteum that fertilization has occurred. The corpus luteum, now under the direction of HCG, continues to synthesize progesterone and estrogen, which maintain the endometrium for implantation. In other words, HCG from the trophoblast (placenta) “rescues” the corpus luteum from regression. (Without fertilization and the stimulation by HCG, the corpus luteum regresses 12 days after ovulation, at which point it stops producing steroid hormones, and menses occurs.) The high levels of estrogen and progesterone also suppress the development of the next cohort of ovarian follicles. Production of HCG increases dramatically during the first weeks of pregnancy. The  pregnancy test  is based on the excretion of large amounts of HCG in urine, which are measurable. HCG is detectable in maternal urine 9 days after ovulation, even before the next expected menses. Hormones of Pregnancy The duration of pregnancy is, by convention, counted from the date of the last menstrual period. Pregnancy lasts approximately 40 weeks from the onset of the last menstrual period, or 38 weeks from the date of the last ovulation. Pregnancy is divided into three trimesters, each of which corresponds to approximately 13 weeks. Hormone levels during pregnancy are depicted in Figure 10.11 . ♦	  First trimester.  HCG is produced by the trophoblast, beginning about 8 days after fertilization. As 4.	  Menses.  Regression of the corpus luteum and the abrupt loss of estradiol and progesterone cause the endometrial lining and blood to be sloughed (menses or menstrual bleeding). Typically, menses lasts 4–5 days, corresponding to days 0 to 4 or 5 of the next menstrual cycle. During this time, primordial follicles for the  next  cycle are being recruited and are begin- ning to develop. Pregnancy If the ovum is fertilized by a sperm, the fertilized ovum begins to divide and will become the fetus. The period of development of the fetus is called  pregnancy  or gestation,  which, in humans, lasts approximately 40 weeks. During pregnancy, the levels of estrogen and proges- terone increase steadily. Their functions include main- tenance of the endometrium, development of the breasts for lactation after delivery, and suppression of the development of new ovarian follicles. In early pregnancy (the first trimester), the source of steroid hormones is the corpus luteum; in mid-to-late preg- nancy (the second and third trimesters), the source is the placenta. Events of Early Pregnancy The events of early pregnancy are summarized in Table 10.4 . The timetable is based on the number of days after ovulation and includes the following steps: 1.	  Fertilization  of the ovum takes place within 24 hours of ovulation, in a distal portion of the oviduct called the  ampulla.  Once a sperm penetrates the ovum, the second polar body is extruded and the fertilized ovum begins to divide. Four days after ovulation the fertilized ovum, the  blastocyst,  with approximately 100 cells, arrives in the uterine cavity.

The newly transcribed mRNAs are translated, and new proteins are synthesized. These new proteins are responsible for the multiple actions of thyroid hor- mones. Other T 3  receptors located in ribosomes and mitochondria mediate post-transcriptional and post- translational events. A vast array of  new proteins  are synthesized under the direction of thyroid hormones, including Na + -K + ATPase, transport proteins,  β 1 -adrenergic receptors, lysosomal enzymes, proteolytic proteins, and structural proteins. The nature of the protein induced is specific to the target tissue. In most tissues, Na + -K +  ATPase physiologically inactive. Normally, the tissues produce T 3  and rT 3  in approximately equal amounts (T 3 , 45% and rT 3 , 55%). However, under certain conditions the relative amounts may change. For example, pregnancy, fasting, stress, hepatic and renal failure, and  β -adrenergic blocking agents all decrease the conversion of T 4  to T 3 (and increase conversion to rT 3 ), thus decreasing the amount of the active hormone. Obesity increases the conversion of T 4  to T 3 , increasing the amount of the active hormone. Once T 3  is produced inside the target cells, it enters the nucleus and binds to a  nuclear receptor.

Thus when thyroid hormone levels are high, the myocardium has an increased number of β 1  receptors and is more sensitive to stimulation by the sympathetic nervous system. (In complementary actions, thyroid hormones also induce the synthesis of cardiac myosin and sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase.) ♦	  Growth.  Thyroid hormone is required for growth to adult stature. Thyroid hormones act synergistically with growth hormone and somatomedins to promote bone formation. Thyroid hormones promote ossifi- cation and fusion of bone plates and bone matura- tion. In hypothyroidism, bone age is less than chronologic age. ♦	  Central nervous system (CNS).  Thyroid hormones have multiple effects on the CNS, and the impact of these effects is age dependent. In the  perinatal period,  thyroid hormone is  essential for normal maturation of the CNS.  Hypothyroidism in the peri- natal period causes irreversible mental retardation. For this reason, screening of newborns for hypothy- roidism is mandated; if it is detected in the newborn, thyroid hormone replacement can reverse the CNS effects. In  adults,  hypothyroidism causes listless- ness, slowed movement, somnolence, impaired memory, and decreased mental capacity. Hyperthy- roidism causes hyperexcitability, hyperreflexia, and irritability. ♦	  Autonomic nervous system.  Thyroid hormones interact with the  sympathetic nervous system  in ways that are not fully understood. Many of the effects of thyroid hormones on BMR, heat produc- tion, heart rate, and stroke volume are similar to those produced by catecholamines via  β -adrenergic receptors.  The effects of thyroid hormones and catecholamines on heat production, cardiac output, lipolysis, and gluconeogenesis appear to be synergis- tic. The significance of this synergism is illustrated by the effectiveness of  β -adrenergic blocking agents (e.g., propranolol) in treating many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism. Pathophysiology of Thyroid Hormone The most common endocrine abnormalities are distur- bances of thyroid hormones. The constellation of signs and symptoms produced by an excess or a deficiency of thyroid hormones is predictable on the basis of the hormones’ physiologic actions. Thus disturbances of thyroid hormones will affect growth, CNS function, BMR and heat production, nutrient metabolism, and the cardiovascular system. The symptoms of hyperthy- roidism and hypothyroidism, common etiologies, TSH levels, and treatments are summarized in  Table 9.9 . synthesis is induced, which leads to increased oxygen consumption, BMR, and heat production. In myocardial cells, myosin,  β 1 -adrenergic receptors, and Ca 2 +  ATPase are induced, accounting for thyroid hormone–induced increases in heart rate and contractility. In liver and adipose tissue, key metabolic enzymes are induced, leading to alterations in carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. The effects of thyroid hormone (T 3 ) on various organ systems are as follows: ♦	  Basal metabolic rate (BMR).  One of the most sig- nificant and pronounced effects of thyroid hormone is  increased oxygen consumption  and a resulting increase in  BMR  and  body temperature.  Thyroid hormones increase oxygen consumption in all tissues except brain, gonads, and spleen  by inducing the synthesis and increasing the activity of the  Na + -K + ATPase.  The Na + -K +  ATPase is responsible for primary active transport of Na +  and K +  in all cells; this activity is highly correlated with and accounts for a large percentage of the total oxygen consump- tion and heat production in the body. Thus when thyroid hormones increase Na + -K +  ATPase activity, they also increase oxygen consumption, BMR, and heat production. ♦	  Metabolism.  Ultimately, increased oxygen consump- tion depends on increased availability of substrates for oxidative metabolism. Thyroid hormones increase glucose absorption from the gastrointestinal tract and potentiate the effects of other hormones (e.g., catecholamines, glucagon, growth hormone) on gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, and proteolysis. Thyroid hormones increase both protein synthesis and deg- radation, but overall their effect is  catabolic  (i.e., net degradation), which results in decreased muscle mass. These metabolic effects occur because thyroid hormones induce the synthesis of key metabolic enzymes including cytochrome oxidase, NADPH cytochrome C reductase,  α -glycerophosphate dehy- — Linda Costanzo PhD - Costanzo Physiology (2021, Elsevier) - libgen.li, 9 Endocrine Physiology, Thyroid Hormones, Halaman 428, 427, 426
[84] the consequences of aging and those of hypogonadism due to pituitary or testicular disease, such as decreases in sexual function, bone density, and hemoglobin, suggest the possibility that the decrease in testosterone with aging may contribute to these changes of aging. A study of 788 men 65 years or older with low testosterone concentrations demonstrated that testoster­ one treatment for 1 year, compared to placebo, improved sexual function, mood, depressive symptoms, anemia, and bone density and strength (Roy et al., 2017; Snyder et al., 2016, 2017). Testosterone replacement, however, did not improve cognitive function or glucose or lipid metabolism. No studies to date have been large enough or long enough to determine whether testosterone treatment of older men will increase the risk of pros­ tate cancer, urinary tract symptoms, or heart disease. The FDA, however, has become sufficiently concerned about the possible risk of cardiovascular disease, based on epidemiological studies and small clinical trials, that it has required a label change for testosterone preparations to indicate that they are approved only for men with “classical hypogonadism,” meaning hypogonadism due to discernible pituitary or testicular disease, and not for idiopathic or age-related hypogonadism (Ngyuen et al., 2015). Female Hypogonadism Few data exist regarding whether increasing the serum testosterone concentrations of women whose serum testosterone concentrations are below normal will improve their libido, energy, muscle mass and strength, or bone mineral density. In a study of women with low serum testoster­ one concentrations due to panhypopituitarism, increasing the testoster­ one concentration to high-normal was associated with small increases in bone mineral density, fat-free mass, and sexual function compared to placebo (Miller et al., 2006). Enhancement of Athletic Performance Some athletes take drugs, including androgens, in an attempt to improve their performance. Because androgens for this purpose usually are taken surreptitiously, information about their possible effects is not as complete as that for androgens taken for treatment of male hypogonadism. Citing potentially serious health risks, the FDA has recommended against the use of body-building products that are marketed as containing steroids or steroid-like substances (FDA, 2017a, 2017b). Kinds of Androgens Used Virtually all androgens produced for human or veterinary purposes have been taken by athletes. When such use by athletes began more than 35 years ago, 17α-alkylated androgens and other compounds (the so-called ana­ bolic steroids) were thought to have greater anabolic effects than andro­ gen effects relative to testosterone and were used most commonly. Because these compounds can be detected readily by organizations that govern athletic competitions, other agents that increase the serum concentra­ tion of testosterone itself, such as the testosterone esters or hCG, have increased in popularity. Testosterone precursors, such as androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone, are also popular because they are treated as nutritional supplements and thus are not regulated by athletic organiza­ tions. Selective androgen receptor modulators, although not approved for clinical use, are available on the Internet.  THG , a potent androgen, appears to have been designed and synthesized to avoid detection by antidoping laboratories on the basis of its novel structure and rapid catabolism. Tetrahydrogestrinone (THG) O OH H H Efficacy The few controlled studies of the effects of pharmacological doses of androgens suggest a dose-dependent effect of testosterone on muscle strength that acts synergistically with exercise. In one controlled study, 43 normal young men were randomized to one of four groups: strength training with or without 600 mg of testosterone enanthate once a week (more than six times the replacement dose) or no exercise with or without testosterone. The men who received testosterone experienced an increase in muscle strength compared to those who received placebo, and the men 997 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY who exercised simultaneously experienced even greater increases (Bhasin et al., 1996). In another study, normal young men were treated with a GnRH analogue to reduce endogenous testosterone secretion severely and, in a random blinded fashion, weekly doses of testosterone enanthate from 25 to 600 mg. There was a dose-dependent effect of testosterone on muscle strength (Bhasin et al., 2001). In contrast, in a double-blind study of androstenedione, men who took 100 mg three times a day for 8 weeks did not experience an increase in muscle strength compared to men who took placebo. The treatment also did not increase the mean serum testos­ terone concentration (King et al., 1999). Side Effects All androgens suppress gonadotropin secretion when taken in high doses and thereby suppress endogenous testicular function. This decreases endogenous testosterone and sperm production, resulting in diminished fertility. If administration continues for many years, testicular size may diminish. Testosterone and sperm production usually return to normal within 4 months of discontinuation but may take more than a year. High doses of androgens also cause erythrocytosis. When administered in high doses, androgens that can be converted to estrogens, such as testosterone itself, cause gynecomastia. Androgens whose A ring has been modified so that it cannot be aromatized, such as dihydrotestosterone, do not cause gynecomastia even in high doses. The 17α-alkylated androgens are the only androgens that cause hepa­ totoxicity. These androgens, when administered in high doses, affect serum lipid concentrations, specifically to decrease high-density lipopro­ tein cholesterol and increase low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Women and children experience virilization, including facial and body hirsutism, temporal hair recession in a male pattern, and acne. Boys experience phallic enlargement, and women experience clitoral enlargement. Boys and girls whose epiphyses have not yet closed experience premature clo­ sure and stunting of linear growth. Detection An androgen other than testosterone can be detected by gas chromatog­ raphy and mass spectroscopy if the athlete is still taking it when tested. Exogenous testosterone itself can be detected by one of two methods. One is the T/E ratio, the ratio of testosterone glucuronide to its endoge­ nous epimer, epitestosterone glucuronide, in urine. Administration of exogenous testosterone suppresses secretion of both testosterone and epitestosterone and replaces them with only testosterone, so the T/E ratio is higher than normal. This technique is limited, however, by hete­ rozygosity in the UDP-glucuronosyl transferase that converts testoster­ one to testosterone glucuronide.

[85] that is blocked by folate antagonists such as methotrexate (see Chapter 70). As shown in Figure 45–5, other pathways also lead to the synthesis of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate. These pathways are important in the metab­ olism of formiminoglutamic acid (FIGLU) and purines and pyrimidines. Deficiency of either vitamin B 12  or folate decreases the synthesis of methionine and SAM and consequently interferes with protein biosynthe­ sis, a number of methylation reactions, and the synthesis of polyamines. In addition, the cell responds to the deficiency by redirecting folate met­ abolic pathways to supply increasing amounts of methyltetrahydrofolate; this tends to preserve essential methylation reactions at the expense of nucleic acid synthesis. With vitamin B 12  deficiency, methylenetetrahy­ drofolate reductase activity increases, directing available intracellular folates into the methyltetrahydrofolate pool (not shown in Figure 45–5). The methyltetrahydrofolate then is trapped by the lack of sufficient vitamin B 12  to accept and transfer methyl groups, and subsequent steps in folate metabolism that require tetrahydrofolate are deprived of sub­ strate. This process provides a common basis for the development of megaloblastic anemia with deficiency of either vitamin B 12  or folic acid. The mechanisms responsible for the neurological lesions of vitamin B 12 deficiency are less well understood (Solomon, 2007). Damage to the mye­ lin sheath is the most obvious lesion in this neuropathy. This observation led to the early suggestion that the deoxyadenosyl B 12 –dependent methyl­ malonyl CoA mutase reaction, a step in propionate metabolism, is related to the abnormality. However, other evidence suggests that the deficiency of methionine synthetase and the block of the conversion of methionine to SAM are more likely to be responsible. Vitamin B 12  and Human Health Humans depend on exogenous sources of vitamin B 12  (see structure in Figure 45–6). In nature, the primary sources are certain microorganisms that grow in soil or the intestinal lumen of animals that synthesize the vitamin. The daily nutritional requirement of 3 to 5 μg must generally be obtained from animal by-products in the diet. However, some vita­ min B 12  is available from legumes, which are contaminated with bacteria that can synthesize vitamin B 12 , and vegetarians often fortify their diets with a wide range of vitamins and minerals; thus, strict vegetarians rarely develop vitamin B 12  deficiency. The terms  vitamin B 12  and  cyanocobala­ min  are used interchangeably as generic terms for all of the cobamides active in humans. Preparations of vitamin B 12  for therapeutic use contain either cyanocobalamin or hydroxocobalamin because only these deriva­ tives remain active after storage. Metabolic Functions The active coenzymes methylcobalamin and 5-deoxyadenosylcobalamin are essential for cell growth and replication. Methylcobalamin is required for the conversion of homocysteine to methionine and its derivative SAM. In addition, when concentrations of vitamin B 12  are inadequate, folate becomes “trapped” as methyltetrahydrofolate to cause a functional deficiency of other required intracellular forms of folic acid. The hema­ tological abnormalities in vitamin B 12 –deficient patients result from this 913 SECTION IV  INFLAMMATION, IMMUNOMODULATION, AND HEMATOPOIESIS process. Deoxyadenosylcobalamin (deoxyadenosyl B 12 ) is required for the rearrangement of methylmalonyl CoA to succinyl CoA. ADME and Daily Requirements In the presence of gastric acid and pancreatic proteases, dietary vitamin B 12  is released from food and salivary-binding protein and bound to gastric intrinsic factor. When the vitamin B 12 –intrinsic factor complex reaches the ileum, it interacts with a receptor on the mucosal cell sur­ face and is actively transported into circulation. Vitamin B 12  deficiency in adults is rarely the result of a deficient diet per se; rather, it usually reflects a defect in one or another aspect of this complex sequence of absorption (Figure 45–7). Antibodies to parietal cells or intrinsic factor complex also can play a prominent role in producing a deficiency. Several intestinal conditions can interfere with absorption, including pancreatic disorders (loss of pancreatic protease secretion), bacterial overgrowth, intestinal parasites, sprue, and localized damage to ileal mucosal cells by disease or as a result of surgery. Absorbed vitamin B 12  binds to transcobalamin II, a plasma β globulin, for transport to tissues. The supply of vitamin B 12  available for tissues is directly related to the size of the hepatic storage pool and the amount of vitamin B 12  bound to transcobalamin II (see Figure 45–7). Vitamin B 12 bound to transcobalamin II is rapidly cleared from plasma and prefer­ entially distributed to hepatic parenchymal cells. As much as 90% of the body’s stores of vitamin B 12 , from 1 to 10 mg, is in the liver. Vitamin B 12  is stored as the active coenzyme with a turnover rate of 0.5 to 8 μg per day. The recommended daily intake of the vitamin in adults is 2.4 μg. Approx­ imately 3 μg of cobalamins are secreted into bile each day, 50% to 60% of which is not destined for reabsorption. Interference with reabsorption by intestinal disease can progressively deplete hepatic stores of the vitamin. Vitamin B 12  Deficiency The plasma concentration of vitamin B 12  is the best routine measure of B 12  deficiency and normally ranges from 150 to 660 pM (~200 to 900 pg/mL). Deficiency should be suspected whenever the concentration falls below 150 pM. The correlation is excellent except when the plasma concentrations of transcobalamin I and III are increased, as occurs with hepatic disease or a myeloproliferative disorder.

[86] metabolic regulation. The activity of a receptor in a given cell depends not only on the ligand but also on the ratio of coactivators and core­ pressors recruited to the complex.  Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as  tamoxifen  and  raloxifene  (Chapter 48) are thought to recruit either coactivators or corepressors depending on the cell. The means by which agonists for nuclear receptors, particularly those for glucocorticoids, exert anti-inflammatory actions involves considerable complexity beyond the traditional gene activation par­ adigm (Hardy et al., 2020). Featuring prominently are mechanisms of transrepression  that undercut the actions of NF-κB and AP-1. Transre­ pression can include competition between dimeric nuclear receptors and NF-κB and AP-1 for coactivators, enhanced expression of pro­ teins by the dimeric receptors that interfere with the activation of such transcription factors, and binding of the dimeric receptors to  negative response elements  (i.e., inhibiting in some fashion gene expression directly). 69 SECTION I GENERAL PRINCIPLES TABLE 3–3   ■   NUCLEAR HORMONE RECEPTORS a FAMILY b RECEPTORS PHYSIOLOGICAL LIGANDS EXAMPLES OF THERAPEUTIC AGENTS C 1A Thyroid hormone receptors: THR-α and THR-β Thyroxine (T 4 ) and thyroid hormone Levothyroxine, liothyronine 1B Retinoic acid receptors: RAR α , RAR β , and RAR γ Vitamin A–derived tretinoin and alitretinoin Tretinoin, tazarotene, adapalene (RAR β, γ ), alitretinoin, etretinate, acitretin 1C Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors: PPAR α , PPAR β/δ , and PPAR γ Leukotriene B (PPAR α ), 15-Deoxy-Δ 12,14 -PGJ 2  (PPAR γ ), many fatty acids and eicosanoids, among others Fibrates (PPAR α ), thiazolidinediones (PPAR γ ) 1H Liver X receptor-like receptors: liver X receptor (LXR) and farnesoid X receptor (FXR) Hydroxycholesterols (LXR), bile acids (FXR) Obeticholic acid (FXR) 1I Vitamin D receptors (VDR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) Vitamin D (VDR), 17β-estradiol (PXR), and a wide range of exogenous compounds (PXR and CAR) Calcitriol (VDR), calcipotriene (VDR) Note: PXR and CAR are activated by a wide variety of drugs in the context of inducing CYPs, phase 2 enzymes, and drug transporters. 2B Retinoid X receptors: RXR α , RXR β , and RXR γ Vitamin A–derived alitretinoin Bexarotene, alitretinoin 3A Estrogen receptors: ER α  and ER β Estriol (ERα), estrone (ERα) Estrogens; selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) tamoxifen, raloxifene, and toremifene 3C 3-Ketosteroid receptors: androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and progesterone receptor (PR) Dihydrotestosterone and testosterone (AR), cortisol and corticosterone (GR), aldosterone (MR), progesterone (PR) Testosterone esters (AR), and the antagonists flutamide, bicalutamide, nilutamide, and enzalutamide (AR); hydrocortisone, prednisone, and dexamethasone (GR); the antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone (MR); progesterone, progesterone esters, and 19-nor steroids (PR) a Listed are receptors known to be activated by physiological ligands, with the exception of CAR, which is included by virtue of its importance (together with that of PXR) to the handling of xenobiotics. b The nomenclature regarding families and physiological ligands is taken from Alexander et al., 2019. c Listed are examples of agents whose therapeutic actions are mediated by one or more members of the noted family, unless otherwise specified.

The loss of a receptor in a highly specialized signal­ ing system may cause a phenotypic disorder (e.g., deficiency of the andro­ gen receptor and testicular feminization syndrome; see Chapter 49). Deficiencies in widely employed signaling pathways have broad effects, as are seen in myasthenia gravis (due to autoimmune disruption of nic­ otinic cholinergic receptor function; Chapter 13) and in some forms of insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus (as a result of autoimmune depletion of insulin-producing cells and interference with insulin receptor function; Chapter 51). Mutations in GPCRs cause a variety of monogenic diseases (Schöneberg and Liebscher, 2021). The same is true for mutations in TRP channels (Moran, 2018). Many forms of cancer are now known to arise from mutations that result in constitutive activity of growth factor recep­ tors and downstream signaling enzymes in the Ras-MAPK pathway, or loss of tumor suppressors and other proteins that regulate cell prolifera­ tion (see Chapter 72). Common polymorphisms in receptors and proteins downstream of the receptor can also lead to variability in therapeutic responses in patient populations from different geographic and ethnic origins (Johnson, 2019). Intrinsic Pathways Regulated by Nutrients, Energy, and Cell Damage In addition to cell-extrinsic regulation of cell growth mediated by growth factors and cytokines, cell-intrinsic pathways that arose during the early evolution of eukaryotes regulate cell growth and survival by sensing the availability of nutrients and cellular energy status. These ancient nutrient-sensing pathways consist of the  AMP-activated protein kinase  (AMPK) pathway and the  target of rapamycin  (TOR) pathway, which work in opposition to control cell growth and the process of autophagy  (González et al., 2020). Autophagy is an intracellular deg­ radation pathway that is important for cell survival during conditions of stress or cell damage. Programmed cell death ( apoptosis ) is also dually regulated by extrinsic factors, including TNF-α, Fas ligand, and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), and by intrinsic path­ ways that sense cell damage. Organ development and renewal require a balance between cell population growth and survival versus cell death and removal, and both autophagy and apoptosis play important roles in normal tissue and cell function. However, aberrant autophagy or apop­ tosis pathways play roles in many disease processes, and pharmacolog­ ical perturbation of these pathways may be important therapeutically — Laurence L.

[87] have a high affinity for triiodothyronine. Consequently, more than 90% of the thyroid hormone that binds with the receptors is triiodothyronine. Thyroid Hormones Activate Nuclear Receptors.

Chapter 77   Thyroid Metabolic Hormones 945 U N I T  X I V heterodimer with  retinoid X receptor  (RXR) at specific thyroid hormone response elements  on the DNA. After binding with thyroid hormone, the receptors become activated and initiate the transcription process. Large numbers of different types of messenger RNA are then formed, followed within another few minutes or hours by RNA translation on the cytoplasmic ribosomes to form hundreds of new intracellular proteins. However, not all the proteins are increased by similar percent­ ages—some are increased only slightly, and others at least as much as sixfold. Most of the actions of thyroid hormone result from the subsequent enzymatic and other functions of these new proteins. Thyroid hormones also appear to have  nongenomic  cel­ lular effects that are independent of their effects on gene transcription. For example, some effects of thyroid hor­ mones occur within minutes, too rapidly to be explained by changes in protein synthesis, and are not affected by inhibitors of gene transcription and translation. Such actions have been described in several tissues, including the heart and pituitary, as well as adipose tissue. The site of nongenomic thyroid hormone action appears to be the plasma membrane, cytoplasm, and perhaps some cell organelles such as mitochondria. Nongenomic actions of thyroid hormone include regulation of ion channels and oxidative phosphorylation and appear to involve activa­ tion of intracellular secondary messengers such as cyclic Deiodinase Deiodinase Cell membrane Cell membrane Cytoplasm Cytoplasm Nuclear membrane Nuclear membrane Nucleus Nucleus Thyroid hormone receptor Thyroid hormone receptor Thyroid hormone response element Thyroid hormone response element Gene transcription Gene transcription mRNA mRNA Synthesis of new proteins Synthesis of new proteins Metabolism Metabolism ↑  Cardiac output ↑  Tissue blood flow ↑  Heart rate ↑  Heart strength ↑  Respiration ↑  Cardiac output ↑  Tissue blood flow ↑  Heart rate ↑  Heart strength ↑  Respiration ↑  Mitochondria ↑  Na + -K + -ATPase ↑  O 2  consumption ↑  Glucose absorption ↑  Gluconeogenesis ↑  Glycogenolysis ↑  Lipolysis ↑  Protein synthesis ↑  BMR ↑  Mitochondria ↑  Na + -K + -ATPase ↑  O 2  consumption ↑  Glucose absorption ↑  Gluconeogenesis ↑  Glycogenolysis ↑  Lipolysis ↑  Protein synthesis ↑  BMR Many other systems Many other systems Gene Retinoid X receptor T 3 T 4 T 3 T 3 Cardiovascular Cardiovascular CNS development CNS development Growth Growth Figure 77-­5   Thyroid hormone activation of target cells. Thyroxine (T 4 ) and triiodothyronine (T 3 ) enter the cell membrane by a carrier-­mediated adenosine triphosphate–dependent transport process. Much of the T 4  is deiodinated to form T 3 , which interacts with the thyroid hormone receptor, bound as a heterodimer with a retinoid X receptor, of the thyroid hormone response element of the gene. This action causes either increases or decreases in transcription of genes that lead to the formation of proteins, thus producing the thyroid hormone response of the cell.

THYROID HORMONES INCREASE CELLULAR METABOLIC ACTIVITY Thyroid hormones increase the metabolic activities of almost all the tissues of the body. The basal metabolic rate can increase to 60% to 100% above normal when large quantities of thyroid hormones are secreted. The rate of utilization of foods for energy is greatly accelerated. Although the rate of protein synthesis is increased, at the same time the rate of protein catabolism is also increased. The growth rate of young people is greatly accelerated. The mental processes are excited, and the activities of most of the other endocrine glands are increased. Thyroid Hormones Increase the Number and Activity of Mitochondria.  When thyroxine or triiodothyronine is given to an animal, the mitochondria in most cells of the animal’s body increase in size and number. Furthermore, the total membrane surface area of the mitochondria increases almost directly in proportion to the increased metabolic rate of the whole animal. Therefore, one of the principal functions of thyroxine might be simply to in­ crease the number and activity of mitochondria, which in turn increases the rate of formation of adenosine triphos­ phate to energize cellular function. However, increases in the number and activity of mitochondria could be the result  of increased activity of the cells, as well as the cause of the increase. Thyroid Hormones Increase Active Transport of Ions Through Cell Membranes.  One of the enzymes that increases its activity in response to thyroid hormone is Na + -­K +   ATPase . This increased activity in turn increas­ es the rate of transport of sodium and potassium ions through the cell membranes of some tissues. Because this process uses energy and increases the amount of heat produced in the body, it has been suggested that this might be one of the mechanisms by which thyroid hor­ mone increases the body’s metabolic rate. In fact, thyroid hormone also causes the cell membranes of most cells to become leaky to sodium ions, which further activates the sodium pump and further increases heat production. EFFECT OF THYROID HORMONE ON GROWTH Thyroid hormone has both general and specific effects on growth. For example, it has long been known that thyroid hormone is essential for the metamorphic change of the tadpole into the frog. In humans, the effect of thyroid hormone on growth is manifest mainly in growing children. In children with hypothyroidism, the rate of growth is greatly retarded. In children with hyperthyroidism, excessive skeletal growth often occurs, causing the child to become considerably — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 77 - Thyroid Metabolic Hormones, Effects of Thyroid Hormone on Specific Body Functions, Transport of Thyroxine and Triiodothyronine to Tissues, Halaman 895, 894, 896
[88] agulation. The Liver Removes or Excretes Drugs, Hormones, and Other Substances.   The liver is well known for its ability to detoxify or excrete many drugs into the bile, including sul­ fonamides, penicillin, ampicillin, and erythromycin. Several of the hormones secreted by the endocrine glands are also either chemically altered or excreted by the liver, including thyroxine and essentially all the steroid hor­ mones, such as estrogen, cortisol, and aldosterone. Liver damage can lead to excess accumulation of one or more of these hormones in the body fluids and therefore cause overactivity of the hormonal systems. Finally, one of the major routes for excreting calcium from the body is secretion by the liver into the bile, which then passes into the gut and is lost in the feces. Measurement of Bilirubin in the Bile as a Clinical Diagnostic Tool Formation of bile by the liver and the function of bile salts in the digestive and absorptive processes of the intestinal tract are discussed in Chapters 65 and 66. In addition, many substances are excreted in the bile and then eliminated in the feces. One of these substances is the greenish-­yellow pigment  bilirubin , which is a major end product of hemo­ globin degradation, as pointed out in  Chapter 33 . However, bilirubin also provides  an exceedingly valuable tool for di­ agnosing both hemolytic blood diseases and various types of liver diseases . Therefore, while referring to  Figure 71-­2 , let us explain this. Briefly, when the red blood cells have lived out their life span (on average, 120 days) and have become too fragile to exist in the circulatory system, their cell membranes rupture, and the released hemoglobin is phagocytized by tissue macrophages (also called the  reticuloendothelial sys­ tem ) throughout the body. The hemoglobin is first split into globin  and  heme , and the heme ring is opened to give (1) free iron, which is transported in the blood by transferrin, and (2) a straight chain of four pyrrole nuclei, which is the substrate from which bilirubin will eventually be formed. The first substance formed is  biliverdin,  but this substance is rapidly reduced to  free bilirubin,  also called  unconjugated bilirubin,  which is gradually released from the macrophag­ es into the plasma. This form of bilirubin immediately combines strongly with plasma albumin and is transported in this combination throughout the blood and interstitial fluids. Within hours, the unconjugated bilirubin is absorbed through the hepatic cell membrane. In passing to the in­ side of the liver cells, it is released from the plasma albumin and soon thereafter conjugated about 80% with glucuronic acid to form  bilirubin glucuronide , about 10% with sulfate to form  bilirubin sulfate , and about 10% with a multitude of other substances. In these forms, the bilirubin is excreted from the hepatocytes by an active transport process into the bile canaliculi and then into the intestines. Chapter 71   The Liver 875 U N I T  X I I I Formation and Fate of Urobilinogen.   Once in the intes­ tine, about half of the “conjugated” bilirubin is converted by bacterial action into  urobilinogen,  which is highly soluble. Some of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed through the intesti­ nal mucosa back into the blood, and most is re-­excreted by the liver back into the gut, but about 5% is excreted by the kidneys into the urine. After exposure to air in the urine, urobilinogen becomes oxidized to  urobilin;  alternatively, in the feces, it becomes altered and oxidized to form  stercobi­ lin.  These interrelations of bilirubin and the other bilirubin products are shown in  Figure 71-­2 . Jaundice—Excess Bilirubin in the Extracellular Fluid Jaundice  refers to a yellowish tint to the body tissues, including a yellowness of the skin and deep tissues. The usual cause of jaundice is large quantities of bilirubin in the extracellular flu­ ids—either unconjugated or conjugated bilirubin. The normal plasma concentration of bilirubin, which is almost entirely the unconjugated form, averages 0.5 mg/dl of plasma. In certain abnormal conditions, this amount can rise to as high as 40 mg/ dl, and much of it can become the conjugated type. The skin usually begins to appear jaundiced when the concentration rises to about three times normal—that is, above 1.5 mg/dl. The common causes of jaundice are (1) increased de­ struction of red blood cells, with rapid release of bilirubin into the blood, and (2) obstruction of the bile ducts or damage to the liver cells so that even the usual amounts of bilirubin cannot be excreted into the gastrointestinal tract. These two types of jaundice are called, respectively,  hemo­ lytic jaundice  and  obstructive jaundice. Hemolytic Jaundice Is Caused by Hemolysis of Red Blood Cells.   In hemolytic jaundice, the excretory function of the liver is not impaired, but red blood cells are hemolyzed so rapidly that the hepatic cells simply cannot excrete the bil­ irubin as quickly as it is formed. Therefore, plasma concen­ tration of free bilirubin rises to above-­normal levels. Like­ wise, the rate of formation of  urobilinogen  in the intestine is greatly increased, and much of this urobilinogen is absorbed into the blood and later excreted in the urine. Obstructive Jaundice Is Caused by Obstruction of Bile Ducts or Liver Disease.   In obstructive jaundice that is caused either by obstruction of the bile ducts (which most often occurs when a gallstone or cancer blocks the com­ mon bile duct) or by damage to the hepatic cells (which oc­ curs in  hepatitis ), the rate of bilirubin formation is normal, but the bilirubin formed cannot pass from the blood into the intestines. The unconjugated bilirubin still enters the liver cells and becomes conjugated in the usual way. This conjugated bilirubin is then returned to the blood, probably by rupture of the congested bile canaliculi and direct emp­ tying of the bile into the lymph leaving the liver.

[89] have similar chemical formulas. However, slight differ­ ences in their molecular structures give them several dif­ ferent but very important functions. CORTICOSTEROIDS: MINERALOCORTICOIDS, GLUCOCORTICOIDS, AND ANDROGENS Two major types of adrenocortical hormones, the  min­ eralocorticoids  and the  glucocorticoids,  are secreted by the adrenal cortex. In addition to these hormones, small amounts of sex hormones are secreted, especially  andro­ genic hormones,  which exhibit about the same effects in the body as the male sex hormone testosterone. They are normally of only slight importance, although in certain abnormalities of the adrenal cortices, extreme quantities can be secreted (which is discussed later in the chapter) and can result in masculinizing effects. The  mineralocorticoids  gained this name because they especially affect the electrolytes (the “minerals”) of the extracellular fluids, especially sodium and potassium. The  glucocorticoids  gained their name because they exhibit important effects that increase blood glucose concentration. They have additional effects on protein and fat metabolism that are equally as important to body function as their effects on carbohydrate metabolism. More than 30 steroids have been isolated from the adrenal cortex, but two are of exceptional importance to the normal endocrine function of the human body:  aldo­ sterone,  which is the principal mineralocorticoid, and  cor­ tisol,  which is the principal glucocorticoid. SYNTHESIS AND SECRETION OF ADRENOCORTICAL HORMONES THE ADRENAL CORTEX HAS THREE DIS­ TINCT LAYERS Figure 78-­1  shows that the adrenal cortex is composed of three relatively distinct layers: 1.	 The  zona glomerulosa,  a thin layer of cells that lies just underneath the capsule, constitutes about 15% of the adrenal cortex. These cells are the only ones in the adrenal gland capable of secreting significant amounts of  aldosterone  because they contain the enzyme  aldosterone synthase,  which is necessary for synthesis of aldosterone.

UNIT XIV    Endocrinology and Reproduction 956 is controlled mainly by the extracellular fluid con­ centrations of  angiotensin II  and  potassium,  both of which stimulate aldosterone secretion. 2.	 The  zona fasciculata,  the middle and widest zone, constitutes about 75% of the adrenal cortex and se­ cretes the glucocorticoids  cortisol  and  corticoster­ one,  as well as small amounts of  adrenal androgens and  estrogens.  The secretion of these cells is con­ trolled in large part by the hypothalamic-­pituitary axis via  adrenocorticotropic hormone  (ACTH). 3.	 The  zona reticularis,  the inner zone of the cortex, secretes the adrenal androgens  dehydroepiandroster­ one  and  androstenedione,  as well as small amounts of estrogens and some glucocorticoids. ACTH also regulates secretion of these cells, although other fac­ tors such as  cortical androgen-­stimulating hormone, released from the pituitary, may also be involved. The mechanisms for controlling adrenal androgen pro­ duction, however, are not nearly as well understood as those for glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids. Aldosterone and cortisol secretion are regulated by independent mechanisms. Factors such as angiotensin II that specifically increase the output of aldosterone and cause hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa have no effect on the other two zones. Similarly, factors such as ACTH that increase secretion of cortisol and adrenal androgens and cause hypertrophy of the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis have little effect on the zona glomerulosa. Adrenocortical Hormones Are Steroids Derived From Cholesterol .  All human steroid hormones, including those produced by the adrenal cortex, are synthesized from cho­ lesterol. Although the cells of the adrenal cortex can synthe­ size de novo small amounts of cholesterol from acetate, ap­ proximately 80% of the cholesterol used for steroid synthesis is provided by low-­density lipoproteins (LDLs) in the circu­ lating plasma. The LDLs, which have high concentrations of cholesterol, diffuse from the plasma into the interstitial fluid and attach to specific receptors contained in structures called coated pits  on the adrenocortical cell membranes. The coated pits are then internalized by  endocytosis,  forming vesicles that eventually fuse with cell lysosomes and release cholesterol that can be used to synthesize adrenal steroid hormones. Transport of cholesterol into the adrenal cells is regu­ lated by feedback mechanisms that can markedly alter the amount available for steroid synthesis. For example, ACTH, which stimulates adrenal steroid synthesis, increases the number of adrenocortical cell receptors for LDL, as well as the activity of enzymes that liberate cholesterol from LDL. Once the cholesterol enters the cell, it is delivered to the mitochondria, where it is cleaved by the enzyme  cholesterol desmolase  to form  pregnenolone;  this is the rate-­limiting step in the eventual formation of adrenal steroids ( Figure 78-­2 ). In all three zones of the adrenal cortex, this initial step in ster­ oid synthesis is stimulated by the different factors that control secretion of the major hormone products aldosterone and cortisol. For example, both ACTH, which stimulates cortisol secretion, and angiotensin II, which stimulates aldosterone secretion, increase conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone. Synthetic Pathways for Adrenal Steroids .  Figure 78-­2 gives the principal steps in the formation of the important steroid products of the adrenal cortex: aldosterone, cortisol, and the androgens. Essentially all these steps occur in two of the organelles of the cell, the  mitochondria  and the  endo­ plasmic reticulum,  with some steps occurring in one of these organelles and some in the other. Each step is catalyzed by a specific enzyme system. A change in even a single enzyme in the schema can cause vastly different types and relative pro­ portions of hormones to be formed. For example, very large quantities of masculinizing sex hormones or other steroid compounds not normally present in the blood can occur with altered activity of only one of the enzymes in this pathway. The chemical formulas of aldosterone and cortisol, which are the major mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid hormones, respectively, are shown in  Figure 78-­2 . Cortisol has a keto oxygen on carbon number 3 and is hydroxylated at carbon numbers 11 and 21. The mineralocorticoid aldos­ terone has an oxygen atom bound at the number 18 carbon. In addition to aldosterone and cortisol, other steroids — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 78 - Adrenocortical Hormones, Corticosteroids: Mineralocorticoids, Glucocorticoids, and Androgens, Halaman 905, 904
[90] resulting in lower steroid-induced morbidities (Vincenti et al., 2008). Calcineurin Inhibitors Among the most effective immunosuppressive drugs in routine use are the calcineurin inhibitors  cyclosporine  and  tacrolimus  (Figure 39–1), which target intracellular signaling pathways induced as a conse­ quence of T-cell receptor (TCR) activation (Figure 39–2).  Cyclosporine and  tacrolimus  bind to an immunophilin (cyclophilin for  cyclosporine or FKBP-12 for  tacrolimus ), resulting in subsequent interaction with calcineurin to block its phosphatase activity. A  cyclosporine  analogue, voclosporin , with distinct binding for cyclophilin and immunosuppres­ sive activity superior to that of   cyclosporine  was FDA-approved in 2021 for the treatment of lupus nephritis (Kuglstatter et al., 2011). Calcineurin- catalyzed dephosphorylation is required for movement of a component of the nuclear factor of activated T lymphocytes (NFAT) into the nucleus. NFAT, in turn, is required to induce a number of cytokine genes, includ­ ing the gene for IL-2, a prototypic T-cell growth and differentiation factor (Verghese et al., 2014). Tacrolimus Tacrolimus  is a macrolide antibiotic produced by  Streptomyces tsukubaen­ sis . Because of perceived slightly greater efficacy and ease of blood level monitoring,  tacrolimus  has become the preferred calcineurin inhibitor in most transplant centers (Ekberg et al., 2007). Mechanism of Action.   Like  cyclosporine ,  tacrolimus  inhibits T-cell activation by inhibiting calcineurin.  Tacrolimus  binds to an intracellular protein, FKBP-12, an immunophilin structurally related to cyclophilin. A complex of  tacrolimus –FKBP-12, Ca 2+ , calmodulin, and calcineurin then forms, and calcineurin phosphatase activity is inhibited (see Figure 39–2). Inhibition of phosphatase activity prevents dephosphory­ lation and nuclear translocation of NFAT and inhibits T-cell activation. Thus, although the intracellular receptors differ,  cyclosporine  and  tacroli­ mus  target the same pathway for immunosuppression. ADME.   Tacrolimus  is available for oral administration as capsules and extended-release capsules (0.5, 1, and 5 mg); extended-release tablets (0.75, 1, and 4 mg); and a solution for injection (5 mg/mL). Sublingual tacrolimus  has been used off-label for the short term in patients who are unable to receive medications orally. Because of intersubject variabil­ ity in pharmacokinetics, individualized dosing is required for optimal therapy. For  tacrolimus , whole blood is the preferred sampling compart­ ment; the trough drug level in whole blood seems to correlate better with clinical events for  tacrolimus  than for  cyclosporine . Target concentrations are 10 to 15 ng/mL in the early preoperative period and 6 to 8 ng/mL at 3 months posttransplantation. Target concentrations are dependent on sampling technique, product-release characteristics, and immedi­ ate- versus extended-release forms. Gastrointestinal (GI) absorption is incomplete and variable. Food decreases the rate and extent of absorp­ tion. Plasma protein binding of  tacrolimus  is 75% to 99%, involving https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 772 CHAPTER 39  IMMUNOSUPPRESSANTS, IMMUNOMODULATION, AND TOLERANCE primarily albumin and α 1 -acid glycoprotein. The  t 1/2  of  tacrolimus  is about 12 h.  Tacrolimus  is extensively metabolized in the liver by hepatic CYPs 3A4 and 3A5. Some of the metabolites are active. The bulk of excretion of the parent drug and metabolites is in the feces. Therapeutic Uses.   Tacrolimus  is indicated for the prophylaxis of solid-organ allograft rejection in a manner similar to  cyclosporine  (see Cyclosporine) and is used off-label as rescue therapy in patients with rejection episodes despite “therapeutic” levels of  cyclosporine . Rec­ ommended initial oral doses are 0.2 mg/kg per day for adult kidney transplant patients, 0.1 to 0.15 mg/kg per day for adult liver transplant patients, 0.075 mg/kg per day for adult heart transplant patients, and 0.15 to 0.2 mg/kg per day for pediatric liver transplant patients in two divided doses 12 h apart. These dosages are intended to achieve typical blood trough levels in the 5- to 20-ng/mL range (Goring et al., 2014). Note that the oral dose of  tacrolimus  depends on product release characteristics (immediate- vs. extended-release formulation) and the specific cocktail of medications selected for prophylaxis. Toxicity.   Nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity (e.g., tremor, headache, motor disturbances, seizures), GI complaints, hypertension, hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia, and diabetes all are associated with  tacrolimus  use. Tacrolimus  has a negative effect on pancreatic islet β cells, and glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus are well-recognized complications of  tacrolimus -based immunosuppression. While combined use of cal­ cineurin inhibitors and glucocorticoids is particularly diabetogenic, new-onset diabetes after transplantation incidence was significantly higher with  tacrolimus  than with  cyclosporine , the other calcineurin inhibitor. Obese patients, African American or Hispanic transplant recipients, or those with a family history of type 2 diabetes or obesity are especially at risk. As with other immunosuppressive agents, there is an increased risk of secondary tumors and opportunistic infections.

[92] tent with the mediation by GPER of some modulatory effects of estrogens (Prossnitz and Hathaway, 2015). A variety of GPER-selective agonists and antagonists have been characterized (Prossnitz and Arterburn, 2015). A GPER-selective agonist is in early clinical trials for anti-tumor effects ± pembrolizumab (Filardo et al, 2021). Mechanism of Action Both ERs are ligand-activated transcription factors that increase or decrease the transcription of target genes (Figure 48–4). After entering the cell by passive diffusion through the plasma membrane, the hormone binds to an ER in the nucleus. In the nucleus, the ER is present as an inactive monomer bound to heat shock protein (HSP) 90, and on binding estrogen, a change in ER conformation dissociates the HSPs and causes receptor dimerization, which increases the affinity and the rate of recep­ tor binding to DNA (Cheskis et al., 1997). Homodimers of ERα or ERβ and ERα/ERβ heterodimers can be produced depending on the receptor complement in a given cell. The concept of ligand-mediated changes in ER conformation is central to understanding the mechanism of action of estrogen agonists and antagonists. The ER dimer binds to estrogen recep­ tor elements (EREs), typically located in the promoter region of target genes. The ER/DNA complex recruits a cascade of coactivator and other proteins to the promoter region of target genes (Figure 48–4B) and allows the proteins that make up the general transcription apparatus to assemble and initiate transcription. Besides coactivators and corepressors, both ERα and ERβ can inter­ act physically with other transcription factors, such as Sp1 (Saville et al., 2000) or AP-1 (Paech et al., 1997), and these protein-protein interactions provide an alternate mechanism of action. In these circumstances, ER- ligand complexes interact with Sp1 or AP-1 that is already bound to its specific regulatory element, such that the ER complex does not interact directly with an ERE. This may explain how estrogens are able to regu­ late genes that lack a consensus ERE. Responses to agonists and antago­ nists mediated by these protein-protein interactions also are ER isoform and promoter specific. For example, 17β-estradiol induces transcription of a target gene controlled by an AP-1 site in the presence of an ERα/ AP-1 complex but inhibits transcription in the presence of an ERβ/AP-1 complex. Conversely, antiestrogens are potent activators of ERβ/AP-1 but not of ERα/AP-1 complexes. Other signaling systems may activate nuclear ER by ligand-independent mechanisms. Phosphorylation of ERα at serine 118 by MAPK activates the receptor (Kato et al., 1995). Similarly, PI3K-activated Akt directly phosphorylates ERα, causing ligand-independent activation of estrogen target genes (Simoncini et al., 2000). This provides a means of crosstalk between membrane-bound receptor pathways (i.e., EGF/IGF-1) that acti­ vate MAPK and the nuclear ER. Some ERs are located on the plasma membrane of cells. These ERs are encoded by the same genes that encode ERα and ERβ but are transported to the plasma membrane and reside mainly in caveolae https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 966 CHAPTER 48  ESTROGENS, PROGESTINS, AND THE FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT (Pedram et al., 2006). Translocation to the membrane by all sex steroid receptors is mediated by palmitoylation of a 9–amino acid motif in the respective E domains of the receptors (Levin, 2008). Membrane-localized ERs mediate the rapid activation of some proteins such as MAPK (phos­ phorylated in several cell types) and the rapid increase in cyclic AMP caused by the hormone. The finding that MAPK is activated by estradiol provides an additional level of crosstalk and complexity in estrogen signaling. Pharmacology ADME Various estrogens are available for oral, parenteral, transdermal, or top­ ical administration. Given the lipophilic nature of estrogens, absorp­ tion generally is good with the appropriate preparation. Aqueous or oil-based esters of estradiol are available for intramuscular injection, ranging in frequency from every week to once per month. Conjugated estrogens are available for intravenous or intramuscular administra­ tion. Transdermal patches that are changed once or twice weekly deliver estradiol continuously through the skin. Preparations are available for topical use in the vagina or for application to the skin. For many ther­ apeutic uses, estrogen preparations are available in combination with a progestin. All estrogens are labeled with precautionary statements urging the prescribing of the lowest effective dose and for the shortest duration consistent with the treatment goals and risks for each individ­ ual patient. Oral administration is common and may use estradiol, conjugated estrogens, esters of estrone and other estrogens, and  ethinyl estradiol  ( in combination with a progestin ). Estradiol is available in nonmicronized and micronized preparations. The micronized formulations yield a large surface for rapid absorption to partially overcome low absolute oral bioavailability due to first-pass metabolism (Fotherby, 1996). Addition of the ethinyl substituent at C17 (ethinyl estradiol) inhibits first-pass hepatic metabolism. Other common oral preparations contain conjugated equine estrogens, which are primarily the sulfate esters of estrone, equilin, and other naturally occurring compounds;  esterified esters ; or mixtures of synthetic conjugated estrogens prepared from plant-derived sources. These are hydrolyzed by enzymes present in the lower gut that remove the charged sulfate groups and allow absorption of estrogen across the intestinal epithelium. In another oral preparation,  estropipate , estrone is solubilized as the sulfate and stabilized with  piperazine . Due largely to differences in metabolism, the potencies of various oral preparations differ widely; ethinyl estradiol, for example, is much more potent than conjugated estrogens. A number of foodstuffs and plant-derived products, largely from soy and wild yams, are available as unapproved marketed nonprescription items and often are touted as providing benefits similar to those from compounds with established estrogenic activity. These products may contain flavonoids such as genistein (Table 48–1) that display estrogenic activity in laboratory tests, albeit generally much less than that of estra­ diol. In theory, these preparations could produce appreciable estrogenic effects, but their efficacy at relevant doses has not been established in human trials (Fitzpatrick, 2003). Administration of estradiol via transdermal patches provides slow, sustained release of the hormone, systemic distribution, and more con­ stant blood levels than oral dosing. Estradiol is also available as a topi­ cal emulsion applied to the upper thigh and calf or as a gel applied once — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[93] phosphorylation and activation of the intracellular associ- ated JAK2 molecules. The activated JAK2 molecules then phosphorylate other tyrosine residues within the leptin receptor–JAK2 complex to mediate intracellular signaling. The intracellular signals include phosphorylation of  signal transducer and activator of transcription  (STAT) proteins, which activates transcription by leptin target genes to initiate protein synthesis. Phosphorylation of JAK2 also leads to activation of other intracellular enzyme pathways such as  mitogen-­activated protein kinases  (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-­kinase  (PI3K). Some of the effects of leptin occur rapidly as a result of activation of these intracellular enzymes, whereas other actions occur more slowly and require synthesis of new proteins. Another example, one widely used in hormonal con- trol of cell function, is for the hormone to bind with a Table 75-­2     Hormones That Use Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Signaling Fibroblast growth factor Growth hormone Hepatocyte growth factor Insulin Insulin-­like growth factor-­1 Leptin Prolactin Vascular endothelial growth factor Activation of enzymes Leptin receptor Physiological effects Translation mRNA Target gene STAT3 STAT3 P P STAT3 JAK2 Leptin JAK2 Y Y Y Y Y Y P P P P P P STAT3 STAT3 STAT3 P P Figure 75-­5.   An enzyme-­linked receptor—the leptin receptor. The re- ceptor exists as a homodimer (two identical parts), and leptin binds to the extracellular part of the receptor, causing phosphorylation  (P)  and activation of the intracellular associated janus kinase 2  (JAK2) . This mechanism causes phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription  (STAT)  proteins, which then activates the transcription of target genes and the synthesis of proteins. JAK2 phosphorylation also activates several other enzyme systems that mediate some of the more rapid effects of leptin. Y, Specific tyrosine phosphorylation sites. Chapter 75   Introduction to Endocrinology 923 U N I T  X I V special transmembrane receptor, which then becomes the activated enzyme  adenylyl cyclase  at the end that pro- trudes to the interior of the cell. This cyclase catalyzes the formation of cAMP, which has a multitude of effects inside the cell to control cell activity, as discussed later. cAMP is called a  second messenger  because it is not the hormone itself that directly institutes the intracellular changes; instead, the cAMP serves as a second messenger to cause these effects. For a few peptide hormones, such as atrial natriuretic peptide,  cyclic guanosine monophosphate , which is only slightly different from cAMP, serves in a similar manner as a second messenger. Intracellular Hormone Receptors and Activation of Genes.  Several hormones, including adrenal and gonadal steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, retinoid hormones, and vitamin D, bind with protein receptors inside the cell rather than in the cell membrane. Because these hor- mones are lipid soluble, they readily cross the cell mem- brane and interact with receptors in the cytoplasm or nucleus. The activated hormone-­receptor complex then binds with a specific regulatory (promoter) sequence of the DNA called the  hormone response element,  and in this manner either activates or represses transcription of specific genes and formation of messenger RNA (mRNA; Figure 75-­6 ). Therefore, minutes, hours, or even days af- ter the hormone has entered the cell, newly formed pro- teins appear in the cell and become the controllers of new or altered cellular functions. Many different tissues have identical intracellular hormone receptors, but the genes that the receptors regulate are different in the various tissues. An intracel- lular receptor can activate a gene response only if the appropriate combination of gene regulatory proteins is present, and many of these regulatory proteins are tis- sue specific.  Thus, the responses of different tissues to a hormone are determined not only by the specificity of the receptors but also by the expression of genes that the receptor regulates . SECOND MESSENGER MECHANISMS FOR MEDIATING INTRACELLULAR HORMONAL FUNCTIONS We noted earlier that one way that hormones exert intra- cellular actions is to stimulate formation of the second messenger cAMP inside the cell membrane. The cAMP then causes subsequent intracellular effects of the hor- mone. Thus, the only direct effect that the hormone has on the cell is to activate a single type of membrane recep- tor. The second messenger does the rest. cAMP is not the only second messenger used by the different hormones. Two other especially important ones are (1) calcium ions and associated  calmodulin  and (2) products of membrane phospholipid breakdown. In some cases, a hormone may stimulate more than one second messenger system in the same target tissue. Adenylyl Cyclase–cAMP Second Messenger System Table 75-­3  shows a few of the many hormones that use the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP mechanism to stimulate their target tissues, and  Figure 75-­7  shows the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP second messenger system.

After the hormone binds to the receptor in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus, the hormone-­receptor complex binds to the hormone response element (promoter) on the DNA. This action either activates or inhibits gene transcription, formation of messenger RNA  (mRNA) , and protein synthesis. UNIT XIV   Endocrinology and Reproduction 924 hormones with the receptor allows coupling of the recep- tor to a  G protein.  If the G protein stimulates the adenylyl cyclase–cAMP system, it is called a  G s   protein,  denoting a stimulatory G protein. Stimulation of adenylyl cyclase, a membrane-­bound enzyme, by the G s  protein then cat- alyzes the conversion of a small amount of cytoplasmic adenosine triphosphate  into cAMP inside the cell. This then activates  cAMP-­dependent protein kinase,  which phosphorylates specific cell proteins, triggering biochem- ical reactions that ultimately lead to the cell’s response to the hormone. Once cAMP is formed inside the cell, it usually acti- vates a  cascade of enzymes.  That is, first one enzyme is activated, which activates a second enzyme, which acti- vates a third, and so forth.

The drug is approved as an adjunct to diet and maximally tolerated statin therapy to further lower LDL-C in patients with HeFH or established ASCVD. A fixed- dose combination of  bempedoic acid  and  ezetimibe  is approved for the same indication.  Bempedoic acid  also has application in patients who are statin-intolerant. Mechanism of Action.   Bempedoic acid  acts by blocking ACL, the cyto­ plasmic enzyme that converts citrate to oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA. In the  de novo  biosynthesis of cholesterol, acetyl-CoA is converted to HMG- CoA, which is the substrate for HMG-CoA reductase, the target of sta­ tins (see Figure 37–4).  Bempedoic acid  is a prodrug that is metabolized to the active drug, bempedoic acid-CoA, by a cytosolic hepatocyte enzyme, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthase-1. Bempedoic acid-CoA is a compet­ itive inhibitor of ACL and thereby reduces  de novo  hepatic cholesterol synthesis by reducing the flow of acetyl-CoA to HMG-CoA reductase. Bempedoic acid ’s cholesterol-lowering effects are thus additive with those of statins. ADME.   Bempedoic acid  is administered orally once daily (180 mg), as is the combination of  bempedoic acid  and  ezetimibe  (180 mg and 10 mg, respectively). Both the prodrug and active metabolite of  bempe­ doic acid  are inactivated by UGT2B7 to glucuronide conjugates, which are subsequently excreted in urine (70%) by the renal transporter OAT2. OATB1B1, OAT1B3, OAT2, and OAT3 are weakly inhibited by  bempe­ doic acid . The glucuronide metabolite is an OAT3 substrate and weakly inhibits OATB1B1 and OAT1B3. Elimination  t 1/2  is 21 ± 11 h, and steady- state concentrations are reached after 7 days of therapy. Therapeutic Effects.   Bempedoic acid  is FDA-approved for the treatment of adults with either HeFH or established ASCVD who need additional LDL-C lowering. As with the statins, reduced intrahepatic cholesterol synthesis results in an upregulation of LDL receptors expressed on hepa­ tocyte membranes, which leads to increased uptake and catabolism of LDL particles and a consequent reduction in blood LDL-C concentra­ tions. Monotherapy with  bempedoic acid  results in a 15% to 25% reduc­ tion in LDL-C, less than with statins. In combination with  ezetimibe , the reduction in LDL-C is around 30%, and triple therapy with a statin reduces LDL-C by 65%. Reduction in HDL-C by  bempedoic acid  is typi­ cally around 5%. Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions.   Therapy with  bempedoic acid is associated with hyperuricemia (thought to be due to competition for OAT2 in the kidney) that can increase the risk of gout. Other adverse effects include tendon ruptures and increased serum creatine kinase, cre­ atinine, and hepatic transaminases. Due to drug interactions that may increase the risk of myopathy,  bempedoic acid  is not used with  simvastatin doses of greater than 20 mg/day or  rosuvastatin  doses of greater than 40 mg/day. Because ACL is an enzyme essential for lipid and cholesterol synthesis,  bempedoic acid  may cause harm to the fetus. Inhibitor of Angiopoietin-Like Protein 3 Evinacumab-dgnb Mechanism of Action.   Evinacumab-dgnb  is a recombinant human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits angiopoietin-like protein 3 (ANGPTL3). ANGPTL3 is a member of the angiopoietin-like protein family that is expressed primarily in the liver and plays a role in the regu­ lation of lipid metabolism by inhibiting LPL and endothelial lipase (EL). Evinacumab-dgnb  inhibition of ANGPTL3 leads to reduction in LDL-C, HDL-C, and triglycerides.  Evinacumab-dgnb  reduces LDL-C indepen­ dent of the presence of LDL receptor by promoting VLDL processing and clearance upstream of LDL formation.  Evinacumab-dgnb  blockade of ANGPTL3 lowers triglycerides and HDL-C by rescuing LPL and EL activities, respectively. ADME.   The recommended dose is 15 mg/kg administered by intrave­ nous infusion over 60 min every 4 weeks. The exact pathway through which  evinacumab-dgnb  is metabolized has not been characterized. As a human monoclonal IgG4 antibody,  evinacumab-dgnb  is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulin G (IgG). The elimina­ tion  t 1/2  is a function of serum  evinacumab-dgnb  concentrations and is not a constant. Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, the median time for serum  evinacumab-dgnb  concentrations to decrease below the lower limit of quantitation is 19 weeks after the last steady-state dose. Therapeutic Effects.   In 2021,  evinacumab  was approved by the FDA as an addition to lipid-lowering medications and diet for patients with HoFH. Its safety and effectiveness have not been established in patients with other forms of hypercholesterolemia, including HeFH. In a ran­ domized clinical trial of 65 HoFH patients who were on a background of other lipid-lowering therapies, including maximally tolerated statins, ezetimibe , PCSK9 inhibitor antibodies,  lomitapide , and lipoprotein apher­ esis,  evinacumab  reduced LDL-C on average by 50% after 24 weeks. Adverse Effects and Drug Interactions.   Major adverse effects include serious hypersensitivity reactions and embryo-fetal toxicity. As such, evinacumab  is contraindicated in pregnancy and in patients with a his­ tory of allergies to  evinacumab . Common adverse reactions (≥5%) were nasopharyngitis, influenza-like illness, dizziness, rhinorrhea, and nausea. Drug interactions have not been documented. Future Developments in Management of Dyslipidemias FH is the most common inherited cardiovascular disease and is associ­ ated with significant morbidity and reduction in life expectancy. It has been appreciated for many years that inherited mutations in specific 743 SECTION III MODULATION OF PULMONARY, RENAL, AND CARDIOVASCULAR genes important for normal LDL receptor function and catabolism give rise to FH, including loss-of-function mutations in the  LDLR  gene and gain-of-function mutations in the  PCSK9  gene. An understanding of the pathophysiological sequalae of these mutations has provided valu­ able insights that have resulted in the invention of drugs that target key pathogenic steps and thus restore, at least in part, normal levels of LDL-C and significantly reduce the cardiovascular risk of individuals carrying these mutated genes. In addition to these monogenic causes of FH, evi­ dence from large-scale whole-exome sequence studies has demonstrated that FH and the associated cardiovascular risks can also be caused by the — Laurence L.

[95] of urinary or plasma LH is valuable to assess pituitary function and the effectiveness of therapeutic doses of estrogen. Effects of Cyclical Gonadal Steroids on the Reproductive Tract The cyclical changes in estrogen and progesterone production by the ova­ ries regulate corresponding events in the fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and vagina. Physiologically, these changes prepare the uterus for implan­ tation, and the proper timing of events in these tissues is essential for pregnancy. If pregnancy does not occur, the endometrium is shed as the menstrual discharge. The uterus is composed of an  endometrium  and a  myometrium . The endometrium contains an epithelium lining the uterine cavity and an underlying stroma; the myometrium is the smooth muscle component responsible for uterine contractions. These cell layers and the fallopian tubes, cervix, and vagina display a characteristic set of responses to both estrogens and progestins. The changes typically associated with menstru­ ation occur largely in the endometrium (Figure 48–3). The  luminal surface  of the endometrium is a layer of simple columnar epithelial secretory and ciliated cells that is continuous with the openings of numerous glands that extend through the underlying stroma to the myometrial border. Fertilization normally occurs in the fallopian tubes, so ovulation, transport of the fertilized ovum through the fallopian tube, and preparation of the endometrial surface must be temporally coordi­ nated for successful implantation. The  endometrial stroma  is a highly cellular connective tissue layer con­ taining a variety of blood vessels that undergo cyclic changes associated with menstruation. The predominant cells are fibroblasts, but macro­ phages, lymphocytes, and other resident and migratory cell types also are present. Menstruation marks the start of the menstrual cycle. During the fol­ licular (or proliferative) phase of the cycle, estrogen begins the rebuilding of the endometrium by stimulating proliferation and differentiation. An important response to estrogen in the endometrium and other tissues is induction of the PR, which enables cells to respond to this hormone dur­ ing the second half of the cycle. In the luteal (or secretory) phase  of the cycle, elevated progesterone limits the proliferative effect of estrogens on the endometrium by stim­ ulating differentiation. Major effects include stimulation of epithelial secretions important for implantation of the blastocyst and the charac­ teristic growth of the endometrial blood vessels seen at this time. These effects are mediated by PR-A in animal models (Conneely et al., 2002). Progesterone is thus important in preparation for implantation and for the changes that take place in the uterus at the implantation site (i.e., the decidual response). There is a narrow “window of implantation,” span­ ning days 19 to 24 of the endometrial cycle, when the epithelial cells of the endometrium are receptive to blastocyst implantation. If implantation occurs, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) (see Chapter 46), pro­ duced initially by the trophoblast and later by the placenta, interacts with the LH receptor of the corpus luteum to maintain steroid hormone syn­ thesis during the early stages of pregnancy. Later, the placenta becomes the major site of estrogen and progesterone synthesis. Estrogens and progesterone have important effects on the fallopian tube, myometrium, and cervix. In the fallopian tube, estrogens stimu­ late proliferation and differentiation, whereas progesterone inhibits these processes. Also, estrogens increase and progesterone decreases tubal muscular contractility, which affects transit time of the ovum to the uterus. Estrogens increase the amount of cervical mucus and its water content to facilitate sperm penetration of the cervix, whereas progester­ one generally has opposite effects. Estrogens favor rhythmic contractions of the uterine myometrium, and progesterone diminishes contractions. These effects are physiologically important and may also play a role in the action of some contraceptives. Notably, during implantation of a fertilized ovum into the uterus, there is a strong increase in uteroplacental blood flow. In part, this is caused by spiral arteries invading into the placenta and main uterine artery. This is initially driven by the strong increase in maternal serum estrogen that stimulates nitric oxide formation and subsequent vasodilation. Estro­ gen stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor and placental growth factor impacting endothelial cell proliferation. Estrogens binding to the estrogen receptors that are expressed in cytotrophoblast cells and in the uterine artery wall stimulate uterine vasculature remodeling. When not present, as occurs in preeclampsia, lower estrogen levels result in altered uterine arterial remodeling, limiting blood flow increases and restricting the growth of the fetus (Mandala, 2020). Metabolic Effects Estrogens affect many tissues and have many metabolic actions in humans and animals. Many nonreproductive tissues, including bone, vascular endothelium, liver, CNS, immune system, GI tract, and heart, express low levels of both ERs, and the ratio of ERα to ERβ varies in a cell-specific manner. The effects of estrogens on selected aspects of min­ eral, lipid, carbohydrate, and protein metabolism are particularly impor­ tant for understanding their pharmacological actions. Estrogens have positive effects on bone mass (Riggs et al., 2002). Bone is continuously remodeled at sites called  bone-remodeling units by the resorptive action of osteoclasts and the bone-forming action of osteoblasts (see Chapter 52). Estrogens directly regulate osteoblasts and increase osteocyte survival by inhibiting apoptosis (Kousteni et al., 2002; Levin, 2008). However, a major effect of estrogens is to decrease the number and activity of osteoclasts. Much of the action of estrogens on osteoclasts appears to be mediated by altering cytokine (both para­ crine and autocrine) signals from osteoblasts. Estrogens also increase 965 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY osteoblast production of the cytokine osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble, non–membrane-bound member of the tumor necrosis factor superfamily. OPG acts as a “decoy” receptor that antagonizes the binding of OPG-ligand (OPG-L) to its receptor (termed  RANK , or  receptor activator of NF-κB ) and prevents the differentiation of osteoclast precursors to mature osteoclasts. Estrogens increase osteoclast apoptosis, either directly or by increasing OPG. Estrogens affect bone growth and epiphyseal closure in both sexes. The importance of estrogen in the male skeleton is illustrated by a man with a completely defective ER who had osteoporosis, unfused epiphyses, increased bone turnover, and delayed bone age (Smith et al., 1994). Estrogens slightly elevate serum triglycerides and slightly reduce total serum cholesterol levels. They increase high-density lipoprotein (HDL) — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[96] direct activation of 5HT 1A  receptors. Viloxazine  is a medication that is used in the treatment of attention- deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and depression. It was marketed for more than two decades as an antidepressant in Europe before being repurposed as a treatment for ADHD and recently launched in the United States. While its mechanism of action was originally thought to be blockade of NET, more recently, it has been determined to act as an antagonist of the 5HT 2B  receptor and as an agonist of the 5HT 2C  receptor, actions that may be involved in its therapeutic effects. 5HT and Sexual Dysfunction One of the most common side effects of SSRIs and SNRIs is sexual dys­ function, such as anorgasmia, erectile dysfunction, diminished libido, and sexual anhedonia. Poor sexual function is one of the most common reasons that patients discontinue taking these medications. The mecha­ nism by which SSRIs/SNRIs cause sexual side effects is not well under­ stood. In contrast, the serotonergic drug  flibanserin , which is an agonist of cortical 5HT 1A  receptors and an antagonist of 5HT 2A  receptors, is approved to treat hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD) in premeno­ pausal women. This disorder is also referred to as female sexual interest/ arousal disorder. Clinical trials showed that  flibanserin  can increase the number of satisfying sexual events in some, but not all, women with this disorder by about one episode compared to placebo during the trial dura­ tion (Fisher et al., 2017). Administration of  flibanserin  leads to decreases of 5HT levels in the cortex and increases in DA and NE. This redistribu­ tion of monoamine levels has been speculated to be the mechanism of the observed response of increased sexual function. Psychosis Recently,  pimavanserin  has been introduced to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with Parkinson’s disease (PD). This drug is a potent and selective inverse ago­ nist at 5HT 2A  with 40-fold selectivity over 5HT 2C  receptors and no appre­ ciable affinity for the 5HT 2B  or other monoaminergic receptors. Typically, patients with PD cannot tolerate other antipsychotics on the market because this drug class functions through blocking dopamine receptors, which results in a worsening of the motor symptoms of this disease. The efficacy of  pimavanserin  in treating psychosis observed in other disease states, such as schizophrenia, has not yet been determined. Clinical Manipulation of 5HT Levels: Serotonin Syndrome Excessive elevation of 5HT levels in the body can cause  serotonin syn­ drome , a constellation of symptoms sometimes observed in patients 295 SECTION II NEUROPHARMACOLOGY starting new or increased antidepressant therapy or combining an SSRI with an NE reuptake inhibitor or a triptan (for migraine). Serotonin syn­ drome is largely mediated by activation of 5HT 2A  and 5HT 1A  receptors, and symptoms may include restlessness, confusion, shivering, tachycar­ dia, diarrhea, muscle twitches/rigidity, fever, seizures, loss of conscious­ ness, and even death. Serotonin syndrome and its treatment are discussed in Chapter 18. Dopamine Dopamine consists of a catechol moiety linked to an ethyl amine, leading to its classification as a catecholamine (Figure 15–7). DA is a polar mole­ cule that does not readily cross the BBB. It is closely related to melanin, a pigment that is formed by oxidation of DA, tyrosine, or 3,4-dihy­ droxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA). Melanin exists in the skin and cuticle and gives the substantia nigra brain region its namesake dark color. Both DA and l-DOPA are readily oxidized by nonenzymatic pathways to form cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and quinones. DA- and dopa-quinones form adducts with α-synuclein, a major constituent of Lewy bodies in PD (see Chapter 21). Synthesis and Metabolism The biosynthesis and metabolism of DA are summarized in Figure 15–8. Phenylalanine and tyrosine are the precursors of DA. For the most part, mammals convert dietary phenylalanine to tyrosine by phenylalanine hydroxylase. Diminished levels of phenylalanine hydroxylase lead to high levels of phenylalanine, producing a condition known as phenylketon­ uria, which must be controlled by dietary restrictions to avoid intellec­ tual impairment. Tyrosine crosses readily into the brain through uptake; normal brain levels of tyrosine are typically saturating. Conversion of tyrosine to l-DOPA by the tyrosine hydroxylase is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of DA (as in NE synthesis; see Chapter 10). Once gener­ ated, l-DOPA is rapidly converted to DA by AADC, the same enzyme that generates 5HT from L-5-hydroxytryptophan. Unlike DA, l-DOPA readily crosses the BBB and is converted to DA in the brain, which explains its utility in therapy for PD (see Chapter 21). Metabolism of DA occurs primarily by MAO in both pre- and post­ synaptic elements. MAO acts on DA to generate an inactive aldehyde derivative by oxidative deamination; the aldehyde is subsequently metabolized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl- acetic acid (DOPAC). DOPAC can be further metabolized by catechol- O -methyl transferase (COMT) to form homovanillic acid (HVA). In humans, HVA is the principal metabolite of DA. DOPAC, HVA, and DA are excreted in the urine, where they are readily measured. Levels of DOPAC and HVA are reliable indicators of DA turnover; ratios of these metabolites to DA in CSF serve as accurate rep­ resentations of brain dopaminergic activity. In addition to metabolizing DOPAC, COMT acts on DA to generate 3-methoxytyramine, which is subsequently converted to HVA by MAO. MAO-B–selective inhibitors, such as  selegiline ,  rasagiline , or  safinamide , can increase DA levels and are currently used to treat PD (see Chapter 21). COMT in the periph­ ery also metabolizes l-DOPA to 3- O -methyldopa, which then competes with l-DOPA for uptake into the CNS (see Figure 21–4). Consequently, l-DOPA given in the treatment of PD must be coadministered with peripheral COMT inhibitors, such as  entacapone ,  tolcapone , or  opicapone , to preserve l-DOPA and allow sufficient entry into the CNS. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE Dopamine was first synthesized in 1910. Later that year, Henry Dale characterized the biological properties of DA in the periphery and described it as a weak, adrenaline-like substance. In the 1930s, DA was recognized as a transitional compound in the synthesis of NE and EPI but was believed to be little more than a biosynthetic intermedi- — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

Both types of tumors are often associated with hy­ pogonadal or hypergonadal function, so perhaps the pineal gland does play at least some role in controlling sexual drive and reproduction in humans.

U N I T  X I V 1027 Female reproductive functions can be divided into two major phases: (1) preparation of the female body for con­ ception and pregnancy and (2) the period of pregnancy itself. This chapter is concerned with preparation of the female body for pregnancy, and  Chapter 83  presents the physiology of pregnancy and childbirth. PHYSIOLOGIC ANATOMY OF THE FEMALE SEXUAL ORGANS Figures 82-­1  and  82-­2  show the principal organs of the human female reproductive tract, including the  ovaries, fallopian tubes  (also called  uterine tubes ) , uterus,  and vagina.  Reproduction begins with the development of ova in the ovaries. In the middle of each monthly sexual cycle, a single ovum is expelled from an ovarian follicle into the abdominal cavity near the open fimbriated ends of the two fallopian tubes. This ovum then passes through one of the fallopian tubes into the uterus; if it has been fertilized by a sperm, it implants in the uterus, where it develops into a fetus, a placenta, and fetal membranes— and eventually into a baby. OOGENESIS AND FOLLICULAR DEVELOPMENT IN THE OVARIES A developing egg  (oocyte)  differentiates into a mature egg  (ovum)  through a series of steps called  oogenesis ( Figure 82-­3 ). During early embryonic development,  pri­ mordial germ cells  from the dorsal endoderm of the yolk sac migrate along the mesentery of the hindgut to the outer surface of the ovary, which is covered by a germinal epi­ thelium, derived embryologically from the epithelium of the germinal ridges. During this migration, the germ cells divide repeatedly. Once these primordial germ cells reach the germinal epithelium, they migrate into the substance of the ovarian cortex and become  oogonia  or  primordial ova . Each primordial ovum then collects around it a layer of spindle cells from the ovarian  stroma  (the supporting tissue of the ovary) and causes them to take on epithelioid characteristics; these epithelioid-­like cells are then called granulosa cells . The ovum surrounded by a single layer of granulosa cells is called a  primordial follicle . At this stage, the ovum is still immature and is called a  primary oocyte , requiring two more cell divisions before it can be fertil­ ized by a sperm. The oogonia in the embryonic ovary complete mitotic replication, and the first stage of meiosis starts by the fifth month of fetal development. The germ cell mitosis then ceases and no additional oocytes are formed. At birth the ovary contains about 1 to 2 million primary oocytes. The first stage of meiosis starts during fetal develop­ ment but is arrested in the late stage of prophase I until puberty, which usually occurs between ages 10 and 14 in females. The first meiotic division of the oocyte is com­ pleted after puberty. Each oocyte divides into two cells, a large ovum  (secondary oocyte)  and a small first  polar body . Each of these cells contains 23 duplicated chromosomes. The first polar body may or may not undergo a second meiotic division and then disintegrates. The ovum under­ goes a second meiotic division, and after the sister chro­ matids separate, there is a pause in meiosis. If the ovum is fertilized, the final step in meiosis occurs and the sister chromatids in the ovum go to separate cells. When the ovary releases the ovum  (ovulation),  and if the ovum is fertilized, the final meiosis occurs. Half of the sister chromatids remain in the fertilized ovum, and the other half are released in a second polar body, which then disintegrates. At puberty, only about 300,000 oocytes remain in the ovaries, and only a small percentage of these oocytes become mature. The many thousands of oocytes that do not mature degenerate. During all the reproductive years of adult life, between about 13 and 46 years of age on aver­ age, only 400 to 500 of the primordial follicles develop enough to expel their ova, one each month; the remain­ der degenerate (i.e., become  atretic ).

[98] other peptides, including  melanocyte-­stimulating hor­ mone  (MSH),  β -­lipotropin,  β -­endorphin,  and a few others ( Figure 78-­10 ) .  Under normal conditions, most of these hormones are not secreted in enough quantity by the pitu­ itary to have a major effect on the human body, but when the rate of secretion of ACTH is high, as may occur in persons with Addison’s disease, formation of some of the other POMC-­derived hormones may also be increased. The POMC gene is actively transcribed in several tissues, including the corticotroph cells of the anterior pituitary, POMC neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, cells of the dermis, and lymphoid tissue. In all of these cell types, POMC is processed to form a series of smaller peptides. The precise type of POMC-­ derived products from a particular tissue depends on the type of processing enzymes present in the tissue. Thus, pituitary corticotroph cells express  prohormone conver­ tase 1  (PC1), resulting in the production of N-­terminal peptide, joining peptide, ACTH, and  β -­lipotropin. In the hypothalamus, the expression of PC2 leads to production of  α -­MSH,  β -­MSH,  γ -­MSH, and  β -­endorphin, but not ACTH. As discussed in  Chapter 72 ,  α -­MSH formed by neurons of the hypothalamus plays a major role in appe­ tite regulation. In  melanocytes  located in abundance between the der­ mis and epidermis of the skin, MSH stimulates formation of the black pigment  melanin  and disperses it to the epi­ dermis. Injection of MSH into a person over 8 to 10 days can greatly increase darkening of the skin. The effect is Figure 78-­10 .  Pro-­opiomelanocortin process­ ing by prohormone convertase 1 (PC1;  red ar­ rows ) and PC2 ( blue arrows ).

Chapter 78   Adrenocortical Hormones 969 U N I T  X I V much greater in people who have genetically dark skins than in light-­skinned people. In some animals, an intermediate “lobe” of the pitu­ itary gland, called the  pars intermedia,  is highly devel­ oped, lying between the anterior and posterior pituitary lobes. This lobe secretes an especially large amount of MSH. Furthermore, this secretion is independently con­ trolled by the hypothalamus in response to the amount of light to which the animal is exposed or in response to other environmental factors. For instance, some arctic animals develop darkened fur in the summer and yet have entirely white fur in the winter. ACTH, because it contains an MSH sequence, has about 1 ⁄ 30  as much melanocyte-­stimulating effect as MSH. Fur­ thermore, because the quantities of pure MSH secreted in humans are extremely small, whereas those of ACTH are large, it is likely that ACTH is normally more important than MSH in determining the amount of melanin in the skin. Adrenal Androgens Several moderately active male sex hormones called  adre­ nal androgens  (the most important of which is  dehydroe­ piandrosterone ) are continually secreted by the adrenal cortex, especially during fetal life, as discussed in  Chapter 84 . Also, progesterone and estrogens, which are female sex hormones, are secreted in minute quantities. Normally, the adrenal androgens have only weak effects in humans. It is possible that part of the early development of the male sex organs results from childhood secretion of adrenal androgens. The adrenal androgens also exert mild effects in the female, not only before puberty but also throughout life. Much of the growth of the pubic and axillary hair in the female results from the action of these hormones. In extra-­adrenal tissues, some of the adrenal androgens are converted to testosterone, the primary male sex hor­ mone, which probably accounts for much of their andro­ genic activity.

Abnormalities of Adrenocortical Secretion Hypoadrenalism (Adrenal Insufficiency)— Addison’s Disease Addison’s disease results from an inability of the adrenal cortices to produce sufficient adrenocortical hormones, and this in turn is most frequently caused by  primary atro­ phy  or  injury  of the adrenal cortices. In about 80% of cases, the atrophy is caused by autoimmunity against the cortices. Adrenal gland hypofunction may also be caused by tuber­ culous destruction of the adrenal glands or invasion of the adrenal cortices by cancer. In some cases, adrenal insufficiency is secondary to im­ paired function of the pituitary gland, which fails to pro­ duce sufficient ACTH. When ACTH output is too low, cor­ tisol and aldosterone production decrease, and eventually the adrenal glands may atrophy because of a lack of ACTH stimulation. Secondary adrenal insufficiency is much more common than Addison's disease, which is sometimes called primary adrenal insufficiency . Disturbances in severe ad­ renal insufficiency are described in the following sections. Mineralocorticoid Deficiency .  Lack of aldosterone se­ cretion greatly decreases renal tubular sodium reabsorp­ tion and consequently allows sodium ions, chloride ions, and water to be lost into urine in great profusion. The net result is a greatly decreased extracellular fluid volume and hyponatremia. Furthermore, hyperkalemia and mild acido­ sis develop because of failure of potassium and hydrogen ions to be secreted in exchange for sodium reabsorption. As the extracellular fluid becomes depleted, plasma volume falls, red blood cell concentration rises markedly, cardiac out­ put and blood pressure decrease, and the patient may in shock, with death usually occurring in the untreated patient 4 days to 2 weeks after complete cessation of mineralocorticoid secretion. Glucocorticoid Deficiency .  Loss of cortisol secretion makes it impossible for a person with Addison’s disease to maintain normal blood glucose concentration between meals because he or she cannot synthesize significant quan­ — John Edward Hall_ Michael Edward Hall - Guyton and Hall textbook of medical physiology (2021, Elsevier Inc.) - libgen.li, 78 - Adrenocortical Hormones, Regulation of Cortisol Secretion by Adrenocorticotropic Hormone from the Pituitary Gland, Halaman 918, 917
[99] The main indication for  labetalol  is hypertension in pregnancy, for which it is one of the few compounds known to be safe (Magee et al., 2016). Centrally Acting Sympatholytic Drugs Methyldopa Methyldopa , a centrally acting antihypertensive agent, is a prodrug that exerts its antihypertensive action via an active metabolite. Although used frequently as an antihypertensive agent in the past,  methyldopa ’s adverse effect profile limits its current use largely to treatment of hypertension in pregnancy, where it has a record for safety. Methyldopa  (α-methyl-3,4-dihydroxy-l-phenylalanine), an analogue of 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), is metabolized by the l-aromatic amino acid decarboxylase in adrenergic neurons to α-methyldopamine, which then is converted to α-methylnorepinephrine, the pharmacologi­ cally active metabolite. α-Methylnorepinephrine is stored in the secretory vesicles of adrenergic neurons, substituting for norepinephrine (NE), such that the stimulated adrenergic neuron now discharges α-methylnor­ epinephrine instead of NE. α-Methylnorepinephrine acts in the CNS to inhibit adrenergic neuronal outflow from the brainstem, probably by act­ ing as an agonist at presynaptic α 2  adrenergic receptors in the brainstem, attenuating NE release and thereby reducing the output of vasoconstric­ tor adrenergic signals to the peripheral sympathetic nervous system. ADME.   Because  methyldopa  is a prodrug that is metabolized in the brain to the active form, its  C p  has less relevance for its effects than that for many other drugs.  C pmax  occurs 2 to 3 h following an oral dose. The drug is eliminated with a  t 1/2  of about 2 h.  Methyldopa  is excreted in the urine primarily as the sulfate conjugate (50%–70%) and as the parent drug (25%). Other minor metabolites include methyldopamine, methylnor­ epinephrine, and their  O -methylated products. The  t 1/2  of  methyldopa  is prolonged to 4 to 6 h in patients with renal failure. Despite its rapid absorption and short  t 1/2 , the peak effect of  methyldopa is delayed for 6 to 8 h, even after intravenous administration, and the duration of action of a single dose is usually about 24 h; this permits once- or twice-daily dosing. The discrepancy between the effects of  methyldopa and the measured concentrations of the drug in plasma is most likely related to the time required for transport into the CNS, conversion to the active metabolite storage of α-methyl NE, and its subsequent release in the vicinity of relevant α 2  receptors in the CNS.  Methyldopa  is a good example of a complex relationship between a drug’s pharmacokinetics and its pharmacodynamics. Patients with renal failure are more sensitive to the antihypertensive effect of  methyldopa , but it is not known if this is due to alteration in excretion of the drug or to an increase in transport into the CNS. Therapeutic Uses.   Methyldopa  is a preferred drug for treatment of hypertension during pregnancy based on its effectiveness and safety for both mother and fetus (Magee et al., 2016). The usual initial dose of  meth­ yldopa  is 250 mg twice daily; there is little additional effect with doses greater than 2 g/d. Administration of a single daily dose of  methyldopa at bedtime minimizes sedative effects, but administration twice daily is required for some patients. Adverse Effects and Precautions.   Methyldopa  produces sedation that is largely transient. A diminution in psychic energy may persist in some patients, and depression occurs occasionally.  Methyldopa  may produce dryness of the mouth. Other adverse effects include diminished libido, parkinsonian signs, and hyperprolactinemia that may become suffi­ ciently pronounced to cause gynecomastia and galactorrhea.  Methyldopa may precipitate severe bradycardia and sinus arrest. Methyldopa  also produces some adverse effects that are not related to its therapeutic action in the CNS. Hepatotoxicity, sometimes associ­ ated with fever, is an uncommon but potentially serious toxic effect of methyldopa . At least 20% of patients who receive  methyldopa  for a year develop a positive Coombs test (antiglobulin test) that is due to autoanti­ bodies directed against the Rh antigen on erythrocytes. The development of a positive Coombs test is not necessarily an indication to stop treat­ ment with  methyldopa ; however, 1% to 5% of these patients will develop a hemolytic anemia that requires prompt discontinuation of the drug. The Coombs test may remain positive for as long as a year after discontinu­ ation of  methyldopa , but the hemolytic anemia usually resolves within a matter of weeks. Severe hemolysis may be attenuated by treatment with glucocorticoids. Adverse effects that are even rarer include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, red cell aplasia, lupus erythematosus–like syndrome, lichenoid and granulomatous skin eruptions, myocarditis, retroperito­ neal fibrosis, pancreatitis, diarrhea, and malabsorption. https://ebooksmedicine.net/ 636 CHAPTER 32  TREATMENT OF HYPERTENSION Clonidine and Moxonidine The detailed pharmacology of the α 2  adrenergic agonists  clonidine  and moxonidine  (no longer available in the U.S.) is discussed in Chapter 14. These drugs stimulate α 2A  adrenergic receptors in the brainstem, resulting in a reduction in sympathetic outflow from the CNS (MacMillan et al., 1996). The hypotensive effect correlates directly with the decrease in plasma concentrations of NE. Patients who have had a spinal cord tran­ section above the level of the sympathetic outflow tracts do not display a hypotensive response to  clonidine . At doses higher than those required to stimulate central α 2A  receptors, these drugs can activate α 2B  receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells (MacMillan et al., 1996). This effect accounts for the initial vasoconstriction that is seen when given intra­ venously or overdoses of these drugs are taken. It may also be responsi­ ble for the loss of therapeutic effect that is observed with high doses. A major limitation in the use of these drugs is the paucity of information about their efficacy in reducing the risk of cardiovascular consequences of hypertension. Pharmacological Effects.   The α 2  adrenergic agonists lower arterial pressure by effects on both cardiac output and peripheral resistance. In the supine position, when the sympathetic tone to the vasculature is low, the major effect is a reduction in heart rate and stroke volume; however, in the upright position, when sympathetic outflow to the vasculature is normally increased, these drugs reduce vascular resistance. This action may lead to postural hypotension. The decrease in cardiac sympathetic tone leads to a reduction in myocardial contractility and heart rate that — Laurence L. Brunton, Bjorn C.

[100] endocrine axis is summarized in Figure 46–1. Discrete sets of hypothalamic neurons produce different releasing and inhibiting hormones, which are axonally transported to the median eminence. On stimulation, either synaptic or by other intrahypotha­ lamic hormones, these neurons secrete their respective hypothalamic hormones into the hypothalamic-adenohypophyseal portal veins, which connect to the  anterior pituitary  gland. The  hypothalamic hormones  bind to membrane receptors on specific subsets of pituitary cells and regulate the secretion of the corresponding  pituitary hormones . The pituitary hor­ mones circulate to the target tissues where they activate cognate receptors to exert cell-specific effects or stimulate the synthesis and secretion of the target endocrine hormones. These interactions follow  feed-forward reg­ ulation  in which the originating hypothalamic signal is amplified by the anterior pituitary, then elicits a regulated response from target tissues and stimulates the production of hormones by the endocrine targets. In con­ trast, the  posterior pituitary  contains the endings of nerve axons arising from the hypothalamus, forming the neurohypophysis, which has direct 46 Chapter Introduction to Endocrinology: The Hypothalamic-Pituitary Axis Dequina A.

Typically, feed-forward signals are controlled by  negative feedback , which permits precise regulation of hormone levels and reestablishment of homeostasis after activation of a secretory event (Figure 46–2). The endocrine target hormone circulates to both the hypothalamus and pitu­ itary, where it acts via specific receptors to inhibit the production and secretion of both its hypothalamic-releasing hormone and the regulatory pituitary hormone. In addition, other brain regions have inputs to the hypothalamic hormone–producing neurons, and hormones produced independently by other tissues target both the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary, further integrating the regulation of hormone levels in response to diverse stimuli. Pituitary Hormones and Their Hypothalamic- Releasing Factors The anterior pituitary hormones can be classified into three different groups based on their structural features (Table 46–2): • Pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived hormones include  cortico­ tropin  (ACTH) and  α-melanocyte–stimulating hormone  (α-MSH). 925 SECTION V ENDOCRINE PHARMACOLOGY Hypothalamus Ghrelin Growth hormone Muscle IGF-1 Secondary target tissues GHRH SST Anterior pituitary Target tissues Liver Bone Adipocyte – – – – – – + + + Figure 46–2 Growth hormone secretion and actions.  Two hypothalamic fac­ tors, GHRH and SST, stimulate or inhibit the release of GH from the pituitary, respectively.
